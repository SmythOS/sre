## üìö Questions & Support

If you have questions about SmythOS:

-   Please visit our developer documentation: [https://smythos.github.io/sre/](https://smythos.github.io/sre/)
-   Join our community on Discord: [https://discord.gg/smythos](https://discord.gg/smythos)

## Quick Start

In order to contribute to SmythOS codebase, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmythOS/sre.git
cd sre
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Configure sre environment.
   Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) expects a directory called .smyth to exist in the root of the project or in the user's home directory.
   (check [SRE Configuration](https://smythos.github.io/sre/core/documents/05-configuration.html) for more details)

```bash
mkdir -p .smyth
#or
mkdir -p ~/.smyth
```

And by default the SRE expects this folder to contains a vault.json file with this structure:

```bash
touch .smyth/vault.json
#or
touch ~/.smyth/vault.json
```

```json
{
    "default": {
        "echo": "",
        "openai": "<your openai api key>",
        "anthropic": "<your anthropic api key>",
        "googleai": "<your google ai api key>",
        "groq": "<your groq api key>",
        "togetherai": "<your together ai api key>",
        "xai": "<your xai api key>",
        "perplexity": "<your perplexity api key>"
    }
}
```

You don't need to provide all the keys, only the ones you need in your tests.

## 3. Build the project

```bash
pnpm build
```

## 4. Run the tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

## 5. Run the examples

The project comes with a set of examples that you can run to see the SRE in action.

for this, go to the examples directory and run the following command:

```bash
pnpm start <path_to_example.ts>
```

The project also comes with a pre-configured vscode debug launch file for the examples.
The debugger will allow you to follow breakpoints in the examples and in SRE and SDK codes.

In order to use the debugger :

-   Select "Debug Current Example" from the vscode debug menu.
-   Open any example .ts file
-   Then hit F5 to start the debugger
