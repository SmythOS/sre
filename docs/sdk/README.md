# SmythOS SDK Documentation

This folder contains guides for building agents with the SmythOS SDK. Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md) then explore the following topics:

- [Agents](agents.md) – create agents and add skills
- [Workflows](workflows.md) – connect components together
- [Services](services.md) – use LLMs, storage and vector databases directly or via agents

The examples folder includes complete sample projects.
