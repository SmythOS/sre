# SmythOS SDK Documentation

These guides teach you how to build agents with the SmythOS SDK using the example code found in the `examples` folder. Each chapter builds on the previous one so you can follow along step by step.

1. [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md) – install the SDK and run a small agent
2. [Building Agents](02-agents.md) – add skills and invoke them
3. [Streaming Responses](03-streaming.md) – show model output as it arrives
4. [Conversations](04-chat.md) – keep stateful chats with optional persistence
5. [Loading `.smyth` Files](05-smyth-files.md) – import agents designed visually
6. [Workflows](06-workflows.md) – wire components programmatically
7. [Services](07-services.md) – call LLMs, storage and vector DBs directly
8. [Advanced Topics](08-advanced-topics.md) *(placeholder)*

The [API Reference](api/README.md) contains detailed information about each class and type exported by the SDK.

Most examples are short snippets that demonstrate a concept in isolation. As the SDK evolves these guides will expand to cover more real‑world scenarios.
