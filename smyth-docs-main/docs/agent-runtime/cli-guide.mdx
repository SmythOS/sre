# CLI Guide

The SmythOS CLI puts powerful agent management at your fingertips. With the CLI, you can automate project setup, run and test agents, manage builds, and bridge visual (Studio) and code-first (SDK) workflows from your terminal.

<InfoCallout title="What makes the CLI different?">
You get command-line access to every major workflow, letting you automate repetitive tasks, script custom flows, and switch seamlessly between Studio and SDK-driven projects.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Use the CLI?

If you care about speed, automation, or repeatable developer workflows, the CLI is designed for you:

- Scaffold a new project or agent in seconds
- Run agents from SDK code or `.smyth` files exported from Studio
- Test, debug, and build agents without boilerplate
- Automate anything, from local scripts to CI/CD pipelines
- Instantly swap environments and configs as you iterate

## How to Install

To get started, install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @smythos/cli
```

You’ll only need to do this once.

## The Commands You’ll Use Most

You can control every stage of your agent workflow right from your terminal:

| Command             | What you can do with it                                   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sre create`        | Interactively scaffold a new SDK agent project           |
| `sre run`           | Run an agent (SDK code or `.smyth` file) on your device  |
| `sre build`         | Prepare your agent for production deployment             |
| `sre export`        | Export agent definitions for Studio or SDK use           |
| `sre help`          | List all available CLI commands and their usage          |

<TipCallout title="Mix and match your tools">
Build in Studio and export to `.smyth` for quick testing in your terminal, or start a project with the CLI, then import to Studio for visual design. It’s all interchangeable.

## How You’ll Use the CLI in Practice

- **Automate your agent testing:**  
  Add `sre run` to your scripts or pipelines to catch issues early.
- **Prototype ideas faster:**  
  Use `sre create` to spin up projects side-by-side and try new approaches.
- **Blend visual and code workflows:**  
  Export agents from Studio, then run or extend them using the CLI or SDK.
- **Streamline CI/CD:**  
  Add CLI steps to automate validation, builds, or agent packaging in your pipeline.

## Example: Scaffold, Run, and Test Agents

### 1. Scaffold a new agent project

```bash
sre create
```

This command guides you through creating a new project with the right structure for your workflow. Choose your language (TypeScript is recommended), give your agent a name, and follow the prompts.

### 2. Run a Studio agent from a `.smyth` file

If you exported an agent from Studio:

```bash
sre run ./my-agent.smyth
```

You’ll see your agent load up and respond to prompts, right in your terminal.

### 3. Run the main agent in your SDK project

In your SDK project directory, you can run:

```bash
sre run
```

This executes your `index.ts` (or entrypoint) agent and streams the result.

### 4. Export your project for use in Studio

To convert your SDK agent to Studio’s visual format:

```bash
sre export
```

You’ll get a `.smyth` file ready to import in the visual builder.

<InfoCallout title="No boilerplate required">
You don’t have to write any extra code or scripts, just point the CLI to your agent and let it handle the rest.
</InfoCallout>

## Example: Add CLI to Your Workflow Script

You can use the CLI in `package.json` scripts or shell scripts for automation.

**Add this to your `package.json`:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "sre run",
  "build": "sre build",
  "export": "sre export"
}
```
Now run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
npm run build
```
You can integrate these steps into CI/CD pipelines for automated agent validation and deployment and lear nmore at the [SRE repo.](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre)

## Troubleshooting and Help

- Run `sre help` for a quick reference of all CLI commands.
- If you run into issues or have suggestions, check [SRE GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre/issues).
- Make sure you’re running Node.js version 18 or higher.

<WarningCallout title="Stay up to date">
Update your CLI regularly for the latest features and bug fixes:
```npm
npm update -g @smythos/cli
```
