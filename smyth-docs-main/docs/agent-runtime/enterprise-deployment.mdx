# Enterprise and Production Deployment

The **Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)** supports enterprise-scale workloads. You can deploy SRE to any environment you control by supplying your own connectors for caching, storage, secrets, and logging.

<InfoCallout title="Why configure for enterprise?">
Choose enterprise deployment when you need strict control over data, security, and infrastructure or want to run SRE inside your own cloud, on-premises servers, or containers.
</InfoCallout>

## Configuration and Custom Connectors

SRE can be initialized with connectors that match your production environment. Use the [Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) to set up these connectors. This example shows a typical production setup.

```typescript
// Production-ready SRE configuration
import { SRE } from 'smyth-runtime';

const sre = SRE.init({
  Cache: {
    Connector: 'Redis',
    Settings: {
      url: 'redis://your-cluster',
      maxMemory: '10gb',
    },
  },
  Storage: {
    Connector: 'S3',
    Settings: {
      bucket: 'your-prod-bucket',
      region: 'us-east-1',
    },
  },
  Vault: {
    Connector: 'HashicorpVault',
    Settings: {
      url: 'https://vault.company.com',
      token: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN,
    },
  },
});
```
You only need to adjust this configuration to match your environment. Your agent business logic and workflows remain unchanged across environments.

<InfoCallout title="Separation of logic and configuration">
Switch between local development and enterprise infrastructure by changing connector configuration, not your agent code.

## Supported Environments

SRE supports a range of production environments:

- Private servers and virtual machines
- Cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Containers and orchestration systems

For Docker and Kubernetes deployment patterns, see the [SRE GitHub repository](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre).

## Security Integration

Integrate SRE with your organization's existing security and access policies:

- Use [Vaults](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) to manage secrets and credentials
- Apply [Roles and Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) for fine-grained runtime control
