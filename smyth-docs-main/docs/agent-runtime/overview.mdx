# Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)

[The SRE](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre) is a unified runtime inspired by operating system kernels, designed for building, running, and managing intelligent agents efficiently. It handles infrastructure so you can focus on agent logic, security, and performance at any scale.

<InfoCallout title="What sets SRE apart">
SRE simplifies agent development with a modular, unified interface for storage, computation, and AI resources. Security is foundational, not optional. The platform is open, extensible, and supports flexible workflows for every stage of agent lifecycle.

## Key Features of SRE

| Feature               | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent-centric design  | Tailored for agent workloads, not general-purpose computation    |
| Unified abstraction   | One interface for storage, LLMs, cache, and more                |
| Modular connectors    | Plug in new services or providers as needed                     |
| Secure by default     | Access control, isolation, and credential management built in    |
| Observable runtime    | Built-in monitoring, logging, and step-by-step debugging         |
| Cloud-native          | Runs locally, in the cloud, or hybrid environments              |
| Scalable architecture | Efficient from prototype to enterprise production               |

## Building Agents: Studio, SDK, and CLI

Use SRE in the way that matches your project or team:

| Method                                  | Best for                          | How it works                                                   |
|:---------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)    | Visual prototyping, collaboration  | [Build](https://app.smythos.com/builder) and test agent workflows in the browser with drag-and-drop UI. |
| [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)     | Developers, automation, CI/CD      | Programmatic agent creation, configuration, and extension in TypeScript. |
| [CLI](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide)     | Scripting, automation, power users | Scaffold, run, and manage agents and workflows via the terminal. |

## Subsystem Overview

SRE’s architecture is modular. Each subsystem handles a distinct part of the agent runtime. For architecture details, see [SRE Architecture](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture).

| Subsystem      | Description & Link                                                                                   |
|:-------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IO             | Handles [data I/O, storage, API routing, and logging](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#io-subsystem).       |
| LLM Manager    | Manages [access to language models, caching, usage tracking](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#llm-manager-subsystem).   |
| Security       | Covers [credentials, authentication, secrets, and access policies](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#security-subsystem).|
| Memory Manager | Maintains [agent state, multi-tier caching, and conversation context](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#memory-manager-subsystem).  |
| Agent Manager  | Orchestrates [execution, lifecycle, monitoring, and component flows](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#agent-manager-subsystem).    |

## Security and Access Control

SRE applies zero-trust principles. Every resource and action is scoped to an agent identity and enforced by explicit permissions.

```typescript
const candidate = AccessCandidate.agent(agentId);
const storage = ConnectorService.getStorageConnector().user(candidate);
await storage.write('data.json', content);
```

For details, see [Security Model](/docs/agent-runtime/security) and explore examples at [SRE GitHub repo](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre).

## Seamless from Development to Production

You can start building agents right away. SRE is initialized automatically for local and standard development. There’s no setup required for common cases.

```typescript 
async function main() {
    // agent logic here
}
main();
```
If you need to customize connectors for storage, security, or scaling (such as using external vaults, cloud storage, or enterprise logging), you can provide your own initialization. This unlocks advanced configuration and full control.

See [Enterprise Deployment](/docs/agent-runtime/enterprise-deployment) and [SRE repo](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre) for examples and guidance on customizing your SRE setup for production workloads.
