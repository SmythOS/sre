# Building Agents with SRE

The Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) gives you a powerful, flexible foundation for building sophisticated AI agents. You can interface with the runtime using the high-level **Studio** for visual design, the **Smyth SDK** for programmatic control, or the **SRE CLI** for project scaffolding and local execution.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
SRE gives you full control and flexibility to design agents the way you want. Rapid prototyping, deep customization, and live debugging are all supported across multiple workflows.
</InfoCallout>

## Pick Your Workflow

You can build agents using the visual **Studio**, the code-first **SDK**, the command-line **CLI**, or combine them for maximum flexibility.

<TipCallout title="Advanced patterns from the SRE repo">
For advanced patterns, sample projects, and the latest updates, see the official [SRE GitHub repository](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre).
</TipCallout>

### Studio (Visual Builder)

-   Drag and drop [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components) to build flows
-   Ideal for low-code teams and rapid prototyping
-   Includes built-in testing and monitoring tools

 **Explore [Agent Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)**

### SDK (Code-first)

-   Write and connect components using TypeScript for full control
-   Build advanced workflows with custom logic and integrations
-   Type-safe, version-controlled, and CI/CD friendly

 **See the [SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**

### CLI (Command-Line Interface)

-   Scaffold new SDK projects from the terminal
-   Run agents exported from Studio locally for testing
-   Prompt and chat with agents directly from your command line

 **CLI usage examples and details are available in the [Getting Started](/docs/agent-runtime/getting-started) guide**

## Building Programmatically with the SDK

The SDK is for builders who want full control in code.

### Key Benefits

-   TypeScript-based and fully type-safe
-   Supports advanced logic, async ops, and [custom components](/docs/agent-runtime/components)
-   Integrates seamlessly with your existing dev stack

### SDK Workflow Example

Create a workflow by instantiating components and wiring them together:

```typescript
import { Component, Agent } from '@smythos/sdk';

const agent = new Agent({ name: 'MyAgent', model: 'gpt-4' });

// Create component instances
const llm = Component.GenAILLM({ model: 'gpt-4' }, agent);
const classifier = Component.Classifier({ classes: ['positive', 'negative'] }, agent);

// Wire them together
classifier.in({ Input: llm.out.Reply });
```

 **Read more in the [SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**

## Custom Components and Skills

Extend SRE with your own custom logic.

### Custom Components

Create reusable logic blocks by extending the base <code>Component</code> class.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@smythos/sdk';

export class MyCustomComponent extends Component {
  async process(input, config, agent) {
    // Your custom logic here
    return { result: processedData };
  }
}
```

 **See how [Components](/docs/agent-runtime/components) work**

### Agent Skills (Tools)

Expose custom functions as callable skills that agents can use at runtime.

```typescript
const weatherSkill = agent.addSkill({
  name: 'getWeather',
  description: 'Get current weather for a location',
  ai_exposed: true,
  process: async (location) => {
    // Your weather API logic here...
    return { temperature: 72, condition: 'sunny' };
  },
});
```

## Real-time Monitoring & Debugging

No matter how you build, SRE helps you see what’s going on inside your agents:

-   Live updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
-   Logs and detailed execution traces per component
-   A step-by-step debug mode
-   Performance metrics for memory, tokens, and timing

## Hybrid Workflows

You don’t have to choose between code and canvas. Use both seamlessly.

-   Start building in Studio, then export to extend with the SDK
-   Use Studio for high-level workflows and the SDK for complex custom skills
-   Import an SDK project into Studio for visualization and debugging
