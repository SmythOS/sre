# Getting Started

<InfoCallout title="Choose Your Path">
You can start building with the Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) using either the CLI or the SDK. Choose the method that best fits your workflow and experience.
</InfoCallout>

## Method 1: Using the CLI <Badge type='Recommended' />

The CLI is the simplest and most guided way to create and configure new agent projects.

1. Install the CLI globally:
```bash
npm i -g @smythos/cli
```

2. Create a new project interactively:
```bash
sre create
```

<InfoCallout title="Step-by-Step Guidance">
The CLI will walk you through setting up your project and configuration, making it easy to get started quickly.
</InfoCallout>

## Method 2: Direct SDK Installation

If you want to add SmythOS to an existing Node.js project, you can install the SDK directly:

```bash
npm install @smythos/sdk
```
or 

```bash
pnpm install @smythos/sdk
```

<WarningCallout title="When to Use the SDK Install">
The direct SDK method is best if you already have a codebase or want fine-grained control over integration.  
For new projects, the CLI is recommended.
</WarningCallout>

Once you’ve completed either method, you’re ready to build and run your first agent.

Continue to the [Quickstart](/docs/agent-runtime/quickstart) for a complete example.
