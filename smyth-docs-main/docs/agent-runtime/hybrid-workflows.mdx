# Hybrid Workflows in SRE

SRE supports both visual and code-based agent development. You are not limited to a single approach; you can use **[Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)**, the **[SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**, or combine them for maximum flexibility and productivity.

<InfoCallout title="Why hHbrid Workflows Matter">
Studio gives you speed and clarity, while the SDK provides full control and custom logic. Hybrid workflows let you design visually, extend in code, and keep everything working as a unified agent.
</InfoCallout>

## The Hybrid Advantage

Some tasks are easier visually, such as mapping out agent logic or collaborating with non-technical team members. Other requirements, like version control or custom integrations, benefit from a code-first workflow. **Hybrid workflows let you take advantage of both methods without compromise.**

This approach is ideal if you:

- Want to prototype quickly in Studio but scale or customize in code
- Work in cross-functional teams where both business and technical stakeholders contribute
- Need visual clarity for agent flows but code-level control for extensions or automation
- Use [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview) for interactive testing and monitoring, but the SDK for CI/CD and integrations

### Best Tool for the Job

| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Rapid Prototyping         | [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)        | Drag components, test flows, and iterate visually |
| CI/CD & Version Control   | [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)         | Store agent logic in Git, integrate with pipelines|
| Custom Logic & Integrations| [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)        | Build custom skills or connect private APIs       |
| Non-Technical Collaboration| [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)       | Enable business users to shape agent workflows    |
| Schema Enforcement & Testing| [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)       | Add type checks and test coverage for agents      |

## Exporting from Studio to the SDK

<InfoCallout title="How it works: Portable Agent Schema" collapsible>
Studio agents are stored as structured JSON, which makes them portable and editable in both code and visual environments. For example, a connection you draw between two components is defined as data, allowing it to be imported and understood by the SDK.

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "sourceId": "llm_1",
      "targetId": "classifier_1",
      "sourceIndex": 0,
      "targetIndex": 0
    }
  ]
}
```
</InfoCallout>

You can take any agent built visually in Studio and bring it into a code-based workflow. To do this, open the agent in Studio and use the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl + Shift + E` or `⌘ + Shift + E`) to export its definition as a `.smyth` file.

Once exported, you can load it into your SDK project to create a fully functional agent that mirrors your visual design.

```typescript
import { SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';
import agentData from './my-agent.smyth';

// Load the agent definition from the exported file
const agent = new SDK.Agent(agentData);

// Interact with the agent just like any other SDK-based agent
const result = await agent.prompt('Give me a summary.');
console.log(result);
```

This lets you programmatically extend the agent with new skills, run automated tests, or integrate it into a larger backend process. You can find complete examples on the [SRE Github Repo](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre).

<details>
<summary>See a full example of extending an imported agent</summary>

```typescript
import { SRE, SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';

async function main() {
  // 1. Initialize the SRE runtime for a local environment
  const sre = SRE.init({
    Cache: { Connector: 'RAM' },
    Storage: { Connector: 'Local' },
    Log: { Connector: 'ConsoleLog' },
  });
  await sre.ready();

  // 2. Load the agent from the .smyth file
  const agent = new SDK.Agent({
    name: 'AINewsAnalystAgent',
    model: 'gpt-4',
    behavior: 'You are a sharp AI industry analyst. You provide concise, data-driven insights on the latest AI news and its impact on the market.',
  });

  // 3. Extend the agent with a new custom skill
  agent.addSkill({
    name: 'formatAIAnalysis',
    description: 'Formats a raw text analysis into a structured JSON report.',
    ai_exposed: false,
    process: async (rawAnalysisText) => {
      let sentiment = 'Neutral';
      if (rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('disruptive') || rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('significant')) {
        sentiment = 'Positive';
      } else if (rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('challenges') || rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('concerns')) {
        sentiment = 'Mixed';
      }
      return {
        analysis_summary: rawAnalysisText,
        market_sentiment: sentiment,
        report_generated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      };
    },
  });

  // 4. Prompt the agent for analysis
  const topic = 'the release of the "Veo-3" AI model';
  const analysisText = await agent.prompt(`Analyze the market impact of ${topic}.`);

  // 5. Use the new skill to process the agent's output
  const formattingSkill = agent.getSkill('formatAIAnalysis');
  const structuredReport = await formattingSkill.process(analysisText);

  // 6. Display the final result
  console.log(structuredReport);
}
main().catch(console.error);
```

## Importing from the SDK into Studio

You can also take any agent you define with the SDK and visualize, test, or debug it in Studio.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Build your agent in the SDK.
2. Export its data structure to a file:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import { SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';

const agent = new SDK.Agent({ name: 'HybridAgent', model: 'gpt-4' });

const agentData = agent.data;
fs.writeFileSync('agent-for-studio.json', JSON.stringify(agentData, null, 2));
```
3. In Studio, go to **Create Agent → Import from File**.
4. Drag the exported JSON file onto the canvas or use the upload prompt.

Studio will automatically load your logic, components, and configuration for visual inspection or extension.

<WarningCallout title="Sync changes manually">
If you edit the agent’s structure in the SDK after importing, re-export and re-import the file into Studio to see your updates.
</WarningCallout>

## Tips for Mixed Teams

- Let designers and product leads prototype in Studio.
- Allow engineers to pull those prototypes into the SDK for productionizing, versioning, and integration.
- Push major code updates back to Studio for continued visual review and collaboration.
