A workflow in SmythOS is a visual, modular sequence of components that defines how your agent processes data, integrates with tools, and takes action, like summarizing a support ticket, sending a report, or calling an external API.

Workflows are reusable, composable, and configurable. To make a workflow available to an agent, you connect it using an **[Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill)**, which acts as the unified entry point for all trigger types: chat, REST API, schedules, or batch tasks.

<InfoCallout title="Workflows are actions your agent performs">
Workflows are visual programs made up of components. Each one accepts input, applies logic, and returns results to guide your agent to take meaningful action.
</InfoCallout>

A workflow is made up of [components](/docs/agent-studio/components), with each component designed to handle a specific task effectively. These might include:

- **Fetching data** from APIs or web pages using [API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/api-output) and scraping tools  
- **Applying logic** through branching, loops, or conditional flow  
- **Running AI tasks** with LLMs, classifiers, and file processors  
- **Transforming data** and passing it between steps using flexible inputs and outputs  
- **Storing context or results** using memory components or the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)

## What Workflows Look Like

Every workflow is built visually in the [Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas). You can design the flow just by connecting components.

Here are some example needs and the workflows that match them:

| Goal                        | Workflow Steps                                      |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Write a blog post           | Generate outline → Write content → Post to site     |
| Answer support tickets      | Detect topic → Search FAQ → Suggest response        |
| Run daily performance report | Trigger on schedule → Query DB → Format and send    |
| Process uploaded leads      | Loop through list → Enrich data → Add to CRM        |

## Core Workflow Components

| Type            | Purpose                   | Examples                                                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Entry / Trigger**   | Starts your workflow      | **[Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill)**                                                                      |
| **Processing**   | Handles AI or data tasks       | **[GenAI LLM](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/gen-ai-llm)**, **[Classifier](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/classifier)**, **[ForEach](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)** |
| **Integration**  | Connects to outside services   | **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)**, **[Web Scrape](/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/web-scrape)**          |
| **Memory / Storage**  | Saves or fetches data           | **[RAG Remember](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-remember)**, **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)**                 |
| **Control / Utility** | Manages flow, timing, and notes | **[Async/Await](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/async)**, **[Sleep](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/sleep)**, **[Note](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/note)** |

## How Workflows are Triggered
SmythOS workflows are flexible and can be triggered in multiple ways, depending on how you plan to use them.

### Trigger Methods

| Trigger Type         | Best For                          | How It Works                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Call**         | Server-to-server, webhooks, scripts | Call the workflow's REST endpoint with input payload         |
| **Agent Invocation** | Conversational or UI-based agents,  |  agents	Triggered when a user interacts with an agent (chat, MCP client, voice) |
| **Scheduled Task**   | Daily reports or timed automation  | Runs on a schedule using cron-based configuration            |
| **Bulk Processing**  | CSV uploads or batch operations     | Each row in the list invokes the workflow individually       |

<TipCallout title="One trigger, many uses">
Once you connect a workflow to an agent via [Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill), it becomes available across all inputs: chat, REST API, scheduled tasks, or batch operations.
</TipCallout>

### Example REST API Request

You can trigger a workflow programmatically using a REST API. Here's a sample request using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.smythos.com/v1/agent-skills/<skill-id>/startTrigger?apiKey=$SMYTH_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orderId":1234,"amount":49.99}'
```

Replace {`skill_id`} and {`$SMYTH_KEY`} with your actual Agent Skill ID and API key.

## Build Your Workflow Visually

1. Drag and drop components from the sidebar to the canvas
2. Connect blue (output) ports to red (input) ports to define the data flow.
3. Name your nodes clearly, e.g., “Summarize Ticket” or “Send Email”
4. Test as you build using the built-in inspect and debug tools

<TipCallout title="Keep it clear">
Add a **[Note](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/note)** to explain complex parts, as it helps when you revisit your workflow later. You can also You can preview your workflow’s inputs using [Form Preview](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging#testing-with-form-preview).
</TipCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Connect External Tools

- Call third-party APIs with **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)**.  
- Scrape live website data using **[Web Scrape](/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/web-scrape)**.  
- Run local tasks using **[Computer Use](/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/computer-use)**.  

<InfoCallout title="Keep your secrets secure">
Store keys and passwords in **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)** instead of pasting them into your workflow.
</InfoCallout>

## Debugging and Deployment

* Open the **[Inspect Panel](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging#inspect-panel)** to watch inputs and outputs in real time.  
* Enable **[Debug mode](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging)** and step through or run the workflow
* Check **[Logs](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging#logs)** for errors and background tasks.  
* Press **[Deploy](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)** at the top right of the canvas. If you need a custom domain, an on premises setup, or container export, see the **[Deployment Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)**.

## Best Practices for Reliable Workflows

<InfoCallout title="Add Logic, Loops, and Memory to Workflows">
If you want to loop through data, run tasks in parallel, pause steps, or store info, see all options in the [Logic, Flow & Memory Tools](/docs/agent-studio/components#choosing-the-right-component) section.
</InfoCallout>

- Start small and expand gradually  
- Use clear names and add Notes to explain complex logic  
- Store secrets in Vault rather than inside components
- Use memory sparingly and only when the agent really needs context  
- Test small chunks before running the full workflow

## Workflow FAQ

<InfoCallout title="Common Questions">

**Do I need every component?**  
No. Use only what fits your needs.

**Why is Agent Skill the only trigger?**  
Because every way to start your workflow uses the same endpoint, you only need to set it once.

**How do I debug errors?**  
Use the Inspect panel and Logs to find where data is breaking. Test smaller parts first.

**Can I change my workflow after deployment?**  
Yes. Edit it in Studio and deploy again to update.

**Can I use workflows for multiple agents?**
Yes. A single workflow (Agent Skill) can be reused across multiple agents or triggered in different contexts.
