# Introduction to Studio

Studio is where you build, test, and launch intelligent AI agents, without writing code. You choose the logic, connect the data, and control exactly how your agent thinks and acts.

<InfoCallout title="What is Studio?">
Studio is SmythOS's comprehensive platform for building, managing, and deploying AI agents. It includes a visual builder for drag-and-drop workflow creation, agent management tools, secure vault for credentials, data storage capabilities, and deployment controls in one integrated environment.

## Start Here: What You Can Do

You can use Studio to:

- Design custom agent workflows with logic, memory, and multi-step reasoning  
- Connect to any API, internal tool, or third-party platform  
- Automate repetitive tasks across data, content, or support workflows  
- Deploy agents securely to run in production via chat, API, or webhooks  
- Test, debug, and monitor everything in one place
