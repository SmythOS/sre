# ForEach Component

Use the **ForEach** component to loop through an array of items. It allows you to run a set of actions for each item in the list, making it perfect for processing batch data, transforming lists, or running sequential tasks.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Manually processing lists is tedious and not scalable. The `ForEach` component automates the iteration process, allowing you to build powerful, data-driven workflows that can handle lists of any size, from API responses to database query results.

## Step 1: Provide an Input Array

The `ForEach` component requires a single input: the array you want to loop through.

| Input   | Required?                   | Description                                          | Notes                                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Array** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The list of items to be processed one by one.        | The input must be a valid JSON array. e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` or `["a", "b"]`. |

<TipCallout title="Dynamic Arrays">
You can pass an array from any previous step, such as the result of an **API Call**, a **Code** component, or a **Database** query.

## Step 2: Build the Loop Logic

Inside the `ForEach` component, you'll define the sequence of actions to be performed for *each item* in the array. Two special variables are available within this loop:

| Variable      | Description                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **item** | The value of the current item being processed in the loop. |
| **index** | The numerical position (starting from 0) of the current item. |

You can drag any component into the loop branch and use `{{item}}` and `{{index}}` as dynamic inputs.

## Step 3: Select an Output Format

This setting controls the structure of the final aggregated `Result` output after the loop completes.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    {
      label: 'Full',
      content: (
        <>
          <p><strong>Full:</strong> Returns a detailed object for each iteration, including the item, index, and the full output of the last component inside the loop.</p>
          <p>Use this for debugging or when you need comprehensive data from each step.</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      label: 'Minimal',
      content: (
        <>
          <p><strong>Minimal:</strong> Returns only the direct output of the last component inside the loop for each iteration.</p>
          <p>Use this for a cleaner, more streamlined result set.</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      label: 'Array of Results',
      content: (
        <>
          <p><strong>Array of Results:</strong> Creates a simple array containing just the output value of the final component from each iteration.</p>
          <p>This is the most direct way to transform one array into another.</p>
        </>
      )
    }
  ]}
/>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Step 4: Handle the Aggregated Results

After the loop has finished processing all items, the `ForEach` component provides a single output containing the aggregated results from all iterations.

| Output    | Description                                                     | Data Structure                                    |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Result** | An array containing the collected outcomes from all iterations. | The structure depends on the selected Output Format. |

```json
// Example with Output Format: "Full"
[
  { "index": 0, "item": "apple", "result": { "output": "processed_apple" } },
  { "index": 1, "item": "banana", "result": { "output": "processed_banana" } }
]

// Example with Output Format: "Array of Results"
[
  "processed_apple",
  "processed_banana"
]
```

<TipCallout title="Using the Results">
You can connect the `Result` output to any subsequent component to work with the newly created array.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Loop Logic Simple:** For complex operations, have the loop call an **Agent Skill**. This keeps your main workflow clean and makes the logic reusable.
- **Handle Empty Arrays:** Add a **Condition** block before the `ForEach` to check if the input array is empty to avoid running the loop unnecessarily.
- **Mind Your API Limits:** If you are making an API call inside the loop, be aware of rate limits. A long list can quickly exhaust your quota. Consider adding a delay if needed.
- **Use "Array of Results" for Transformations:** When your goal is to map one array to another (e.g., extracting emails from a user list), this format is the most efficient.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your loop isn't working...">
- **Check Your Input:** The most common error is providing data that isn't a valid array. Use a **Code** component with `console.log()` to inspect the input before it enters the `ForEach`.
- **Examine a Single Iteration:** In **Debug Mode**, the logs will show the inputs and outputs for each iteration. Check the first loop run to ensure your logic is correct for a single item.
- **Variable Typos:** Double-check that you are using `{{item}}` and `{{index}}` correctly within the loop. A typo like `{{items}}` will not work.
- **Check Component Outputs:** The `Result` is based on the output of the *last* component in the loop. Make sure that component is producing the output you expect.

## What to Try Next

- Combine `ForEach` with an **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)** to enrich each item in a list with data from an external service.
- Feed the `Result` of a `ForEach` loop into a **[GenAI LLM Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/gen-ai-llm)** to generate a summary of the processed items.
