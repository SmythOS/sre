# RAG Remember Component

Use the **RAG Remember** component to add or update information in your agent's long-term memory. This component allows the agent to learn new facts, documents, or data, making its knowledge base expandable and dynamic.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
An agent's true power comes from its knowledge. The `RAG Remember` component is how you teach your agent new things, turning it from a static tool into a learning system that can grow and adapt over time with new information.

## Step 1: Define the Namespace and Source Details

Specify where to store the information and how to identify it.

| Setting             | Required?                   | Description                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Namespace** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | Select the knowledge base (namespace) where this information will be stored.                                                             |
| **Source Identifier** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | A unique ID for this piece of data. If an entry with this ID already exists, it will be updated. Otherwise, a new one will be created. |
| **Label** | <Badge type="optional">No</Badge>  | A human-readable name or description for the data source, which can help with organization.                                              |
| **Metadata** | <Badge type="optional">No</Badge>  | A JSON object for storing additional, structured information about the data source (e.g., `{"category": "product_docs", "version": 1.2}`). |

<TipCallout title="Using Source Identifiers">
Think of the `Source Identifier` as a filename. It gives you a way to reference, update, or delete this specific piece of knowledge later using the **[RAG Forget Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-forget)**.

## Step 2: Provide the Source Data

This is the actual content you want the agent to remember.

| Input   | Required?                   | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source**| <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The data to be stored in the knowledge base. This is typically a large block of text, but can be other data types. You can also connect additional custom inputs to be stored as metadata. |

## Step 3: Handle the Output

The component provides a simple success or failure indicator.

| Output    | Description                                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Success** | Returns `true` if the data was successfully added or updated, otherwise returns an empty value. |

## Best Practices

- **Keep Data Chunking in Mind:** RAG systems work best with well-structured, reasonably sized chunks of text. Instead of remembering a single 100-page document, consider breaking it into smaller sections or paragraphs and remembering each one individually with its own source identifier.
- **Use Rich Metadata:** Good metadata is key to effective searching later on. Include relevant keywords, categories, dates, or source information to help the **[RAG Search Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-search)** find the most relevant information.
- **Create Dynamic Learning Loops:** Have your agent take the output of a conversation or an analysis from an LLM and feed it into `RAG Remember`. This allows the agent to learn from its interactions.
- **Structure Your Namespaces:** Use different namespaces to separate different types of knowledge (e.g., "product-manuals," "customer-faq," "internal-policies").

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your agent isn't remembering...">
- **Check the `Success` Output:** If the `Success` output is empty, the operation failed. This could be due to invalid inputs, incorrect namespace permissions, or a problem with the underlying data store.
- **Data Cannot Be Found Later:** Ensure you are using the correct `Namespace` when you try to search for the data. Also, check that your `Source` data is descriptive enough to be found by a search query.
- **Updating vs. Creating:** Remember that if you use an existing `Source Identifier`, you will overwrite the previous entry. If you want to add new information, ensure you use a new, unique identifier.

## What to Try Next

- After a conversation with a user, use a **[GenAI LLM Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/gen-ai-llm)** to summarize the key takeaways, and then use `RAG Remember` to store that summary in a "conversation-history" namespace.
- Create a workflow that reads files from a folder, loops through them with **[ForEach](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)**, and uses `RAG Remember` to add each file's content to the knowledge base.
- Pair this component with **[RAG Search](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-search)** and **[RAG Forget](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-forget)** to build a complete lifecycle for your agent's knowledge management.
