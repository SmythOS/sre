# Timestamp Component

Use the **Timestamp** component to get the current server time at the exact moment it is executed in a workflow. It provides a precise, standardized timestamp essential for logging, measuring durations, and creating time-based records.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Accurate timing is fundamental for many automated processes. Whether you need to log when an event occurred, calculate how long a process took, or generate a unique, time-based identifier, this component provides a reliable and simple way to get a server-authoritative timestamp.

## Step 1: How It Works

The Timestamp component is straightforward. It has no settings to configure; it simply activates when triggered by the workflow and provides a single output.

### Input
| Input     | Required?                   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trigger** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | Initiates the component's operation. Any value connected to this input will trigger it. |

### Output
| Output      | Description                                                                                             |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Timestamp** | The server timestamp, formatted as a Unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds (e.g., `1713523863530`).       |

<TipCallout title="What is a Unix Timestamp?">
A Unix timestamp represents the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since midnight (00:00:00 UTC) on January 1, 1970. It is a universal standard for representing time that is independent of time zones.

## Best Practices

- **Create Timestamps for Logs:** Place this component at key stages of your workflow to log when specific events happen.
- **Measure Durations:** Place one `Timestamp` component at the beginning of a process and another at the end. Use a **Code Component** to subtract the start time from the end time to calculate the duration.
- **Generate Unique IDs:** Combine the `Timestamp` output with other data to create unique identifiers for transactions, records, or filenames.
- **Record Event Times:** When an event occurs (like an API call is received), use the `Timestamp` component immediately to capture the precise time of the event.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your timestamp seems incorrect...">
- **It's in UTC:** The timestamp is generated from the server's clock, which is set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is not the user's local time. If you need to display it in a local time zone, you will need to convert it using a **Code Component**.
- **It's a Large Number:** The output is in *milliseconds*, which results in a long number (e.g., 13 digits). This is the standard format. If a system requires seconds, you will need to divide the value by 1000.
- **Component Doesn't Run:** The component must be triggered. Ensure its `Trigger` input is connected to the output of a preceding component in the workflow.

## What to Try Next

- Use a **[Code Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/code)** to format the raw millisecond timestamp into a human-readable date string (e.g., "2024-10-26 at 5:30 PM").
- Log the `Timestamp` output to a database or a Google Sheet alongside other event data to create an audit trail.
- Combine the timestamp with a user ID and hash it using the **[Hash Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/crypto/hash)** to create a unique, reproducible session identifier.
