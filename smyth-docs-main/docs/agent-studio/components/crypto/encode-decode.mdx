# Encode/Decode Component

Use the **Encode/Decode** component to transform data into various standard encoding formats and back again. It's essential for ensuring data integrity, compatibility with different systems, and preparing data for safe transmission.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Many systems, especially web APIs, require data to be in a specific format (like Base64) to be transmitted correctly. This component allows your agent to seamlessly convert data, making it compatible with a wide range of services without custom code.

## Step 1: Select an Action and Encoding Method

First, choose whether you want to `Encode` or `Decode` data. Then, select the specific encoding format to use.

| Setting   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Action**| Choose `Encode` to convert data into a new format, or `Decode` to revert it back to its original form. |
| **Encoding**| Select the specific method: `hex`, `base64`, `base64url`, or `latin1`.    |

<TipCallout title="Which Encoding Should I Use?">
- **`base64`**: The most common format for including binary data (like images) in text-based contexts like JSON payloads.
- **`base64url`**: A URL-safe version of Base64, ideal for including in URL parameters without issues.
- **`hex`**: Useful for cryptographic applications or when a human-readable binary representation is needed.

## Step 2: Provide Input Data

The component has a single input field to receive the data you want to process.

| Input   | Required?                   | Description                                                |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data**| <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The data to be encoded or decoded. Can be a string or binary data. |

## Step 3: Handle the Output Data

A single output field provides the result of the transformation.

| Output   | Description                                                     |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Output** | The processed data, either newly encoded or returned to its original decoded state. |

## Best Practices

- **Match the Action to the Data:** Ensure you are using `Decode` on data that is actually encoded, and `Encode` on raw data. Applying the wrong action will result in an error or garbage output.
- **Prepare Data for APIs:** Use this component to encode data right before passing it to an **API Call** that requires a specific format.
- **Handle Different Character Sets:** Be mindful of character sets. `latin1` is useful for certain legacy systems, but `base64` is generally more universal for handling complex data.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your transformation fails...">
- **Decoding Error:** The most common issue is trying to decode a string that is not a valid representation of the selected encoding format (e.g., trying to `base64` decode a regular sentence). Verify your input data is correctly formatted.
- **Incorrect Output:** Double-check that you have selected the correct `Encoding` method. For example, `base64` and `base64url` are similar but not identical, and decoding with the wrong one will fail.
- **Binary Data Issues:** If you are encoding binary data (like an image file), ensure it is being passed correctly to the `Data` input field before the encoding step.

## What to Try Next

- Take the output from an **[Image Generator](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/image-generator)**, `base64` encode it, and send it as part of a JSON payload in an **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)**.
- Receive a `base64url` encoded token from an API response, decode it, and then use a **[JSON Filter](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/json-filter)** to parse the resulting JSON object.
- Use the **[Hash Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/crypto/hash)** on a piece of data, then `hex` encode the resulting hash for display or storage.
