# API Output Component

Use the **API Output** component to structure and standardize the final output of a workflow. It's especially powerful when used as the final step in an **[Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill)**, ensuring that any workflow acting as an API endpoint returns a clean, predictable, and well-formed JSON response.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Consistent and clean outputs are crucial for building reliable agents. The `API Output` component acts as a formal "return" statement for your workflows, making them easier to call, debug, and integrate with other systems.

## Step 1: Define the Output Fields (Inputs)

The "inputs" of this component are actually the fields you want to include in your final JSON output object. For each key-value pair you want in the response, you will add one input.

| Field           | Required?                   | Description                                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The key name for the field in the final JSON output (e.g., `data`). |
| **Type** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The data type (e.g., String, Number, Array, Object).              |
| **Optional** | <Badge type="optional">No</Badge>  | Marks the field as not required to be present in the output.      |
| **Default Value** | <Badge type="optional">No</Badge>  | A fallback value to use if the connected input is empty.          |

<TipCallout title="Structuring a Response">
Think of each input as a field in your final JSON response. If you want a response like `{"status": "success", "data": {...}}`, you would create two inputs named `status` and `data`.

## Step 2: Select an Output Format

This setting controls the structure and level of detail in the final JSON object.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    {
      label: 'Full',
      content: (
        <>
          <p><strong>Full (Default):</strong> Returns a detailed object including component metadata like names and descriptions for each field.</p>
          <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Debugging and getting a comprehensive view of the output structure.</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      label: 'Minimal',
      content: (
        <>
          <p><strong>Minimal:</strong> Returns a clean JSON object with only the names and values of the fields you defined.</p>
          <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Most production use cases where you need a simple, predictable response.</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      label: 'Raw',
      content: (
        <>
          <p><strong>Raw:</strong> Outputs the data without any processing or structuring from the component.</p>
          <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Scenarios where you need to pass through data to another system that expects a specific, unprocessed format.</p>
        </>
      )
    }
  ]}
/>

## Step 3: Handle the Final Output

The component produces a single, consolidated JSON object based on your defined inputs and selected format.

| Output   | Description                                           | Data Structure                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Output** | The final, structured JSON object representing the workflow's result. | A valid JSON object. The exact structure depends on the `Output Format`. |

**Example (Minimal Format):**
If you have two inputs, `status` (value: "ok") and `user_id` (value: 123), the output would be:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "user_id": 123
}
```

## Best Practices

- **End Skills with API Output:** Always use `API Output` as the final step for any **Agent Skill** that has "Advanced Request Parts" enabled. This creates a formal, reliable contract for your skill's response.
- **Standardize Your Responses:** Adopt a consistent response structure across all your skills (e.g., `{ "success": true, "data": {...} }` or `{ "success": false, "error": {...} }`). This makes your agent more robust and easier to integrate with.
- **Use Minimal for Production:** The `Minimal` format is almost always the right choice for live skills, as it provides a clean and predictable output without unnecessary metadata.
- **Connect All Inputs:** Ensure every input field in the `API Output` component is connected to the data it's supposed to represent from earlier in your workflow.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your output is incorrect...">
- **Check the Output Format:** The most common issue is having the wrong format selected. If your output contains extra metadata you don't want, switch from `Full` to `Minimal`.
- **Missing Fields:** If a field is missing from your output, check that its corresponding input is correctly named and connected to a data source in your workflow.
- **Incorrect Data Structure:** Ensure the data you are passing into the inputs matches the `Type` you selected for each. For example, don't pass a string into an input that is typed as an `Object`.

## What to Try Next

- Make this the final component in an **[Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill)** to define its return value.
- Call a skill that uses `API Output` from an external application to see how it receives the clean, structured JSON response.
