# Note Component

Use the **Note** component to add comments, instructions, and documentation directly onto your workflow canvas. It's a simple but powerful tool for keeping your workflows organized, understandable, and easy for collaborators to follow.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
As workflows grow in complexity, they can become difficult to understand at a glance. Notes provide context where it's needed most, explaining complex logic, leaving instructions for teammates, or simply labeling different sections of your agent's process.

## Step 1: Customize Content and Appearance

The Note component is configured directly from its settings panel. There are no functional inputs or outputs; it is purely for documentation.

| Setting             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Title** | The main header for your note. To edit, hover over the title on the component itself and click the edit icon. |
| **Description** | The main body content of the note. This is where you write your detailed comments or instructions. |
| **Text Color** | Sets the color of the title and description text using a hex code color picker. |
| **Background Color**| Sets the background color of the note card using a hex code color picker.   |

<TipCallout title="Color Coding">
Use different background colors to visually categorize your notes. For example, use red for warnings, blue for general information, and green for completed sections.

## Best Practices

- **Document Complex Logic:** Place a Note next to a **Code** component or a complex **ForEach Loop** to explain what it does, why it's there, and what its inputs/outputs are.
- **Leave Instructions:** If you're collaborating, use Notes to leave messages for your teammates, such as "TODO: Connect this to the production database" or "Warning: Do not change this API key."
- **Create Visual Sections:** Use large Notes with just a title as headers to break your workflow into logical sections (e.g., "Step 1: Ingest Data," "Step 2: Process Records," "Step 3: Send Notifications").
- **Ensure Readability:** Choose a `Text Color` and `Background Color` with sufficient contrast to make your notes easy to read.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="Having trouble with a Note?">
- **Cannot Edit Title:** The title is edited on the component itself, not in the settings panel. Hover your mouse over the note's title in the workflow, and an edit (pencil) icon will appear.
- **Note is Hard to Read:** The contrast between your chosen text and background colors is likely too low. Adjust the colors in the settings panel to improve readability.
- **Component has no connectors:** This is by design. The Note component is purely for documentation and does not process or pass data, so it has no input or output nodes to connect.

## What to Try Next

- Place a `Note` next to an **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)** component to document the endpoint's purpose and expected response format.
- Use several `Note` components to create a "storyboard" for your workflow, outlining each major step before you build the logic.
- Create a "Key" or "Legend" at the top of your workflow using Notes to explain the color-coding system you've used for other notes.
