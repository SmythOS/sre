# Logic OR Component

Use the **Logic OR** component to check if **at least one** of multiple conditions is met. This component acts as a gate that allows the workflow to proceed down the "Verified" path if any of its inputs evaluates to `true`.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Workflows often need to handle multiple possible success paths. The `Logic OR` component is perfect for these scenarios, allowing you to create flexible conditions like "proceed if a user provides an email OR a phone number" or "trigger a process if an order is new OR has been updated." It simplifies checking for any one of several valid conditions.

## Step 1: Understand the Logic

The component takes multiple inputs and provides two outputs: `Verified` and `Unverified`. The `Verified` path is triggered if **any** of the inputs are `true`. The `Unverified` path is only triggered if **all** inputs are `false`.

In this context:
- **`True`**: Any input that has a value (e.g., a non-empty string, any number, the boolean `true`, an object, an array).
- **`False`**: Any input that is empty, `null`, `undefined`, or the boolean `false`.

### Operational Rules

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Verified Path (Outputs `true`) | Unverified Path (Outputs `true`) |
|:--------|:--------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| `True`  | `True`  | **Active** | Inactive                         |
| `True`  | `False` | **Active** | Inactive                         |
| `False` | `True`  | **Active** | Inactive                         |
| `False` | `False` | Inactive                       | **Active** |

## Step 2: Provide Inputs

You can add two or more inputs to the component. These inputs will typically be connected to the outputs of previous components in your workflow.

| Action      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add Input** | Click the `+` icon to add a new input field. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the condition you are checking. |

## Step 3: Handle the Outputs

The component has two output branches, allowing you to direct the workflow based on whether any of the conditions were met.

| Output       | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verified** | This path executes if **at least one** of the inputs evaluates to `true`.                               |
| **Unverified** | This path executes only if **all** of the inputs evaluate to `false`.                                    |

<TipCallout title="Branching Your Workflow">
Connect the `Verified` output to the steps that should run when any valid condition is met. Connect the `Unverified` output to a path that handles the case where no conditions were satisfied, which might involve ending the workflow or sending an error message.

## Best Practices

- **Checking for Presence:** Use `Logic OR` to check if a user has provided at least one of several optional contact methods.
- **Handling Multiple Success States:** If an `API Call` can return several different success codes (e.g., 200, 201, 202), you can check for each of them with an `OR` condition to proceed.
- **Consolidating Error Conditions:** You can use `Logic OR` to check for multiple possible error states. If any of them are true, you can route the workflow to a single, centralized error-handling block.
- **Keep Inputs Related:** For clarity, the inputs to a single `Logic OR` component should represent related conditions (e.g., checking different types of user IDs, not mixing a user ID check with a payment status check).

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your logic isn't branching as expected...">
- **Check Your "False" Values:** Remember that an empty string (`""`), `null`, or an unassigned variable will be treated as `false`. An input you expect to be false might contain a value (like the string "false"), which evaluates to `true`.
- **Inspect Input Data:** Use the **Debug** panel to check the exact value being passed into each input of the `Logic OR` component to confirm they are what you expect.
- **It Only Takes One:** The `Verified` path will be taken if even a single input is true. If the workflow is unexpectedly going down the "verified" path, systematically check each input to find the one that is evaluating to `true`.

## What to Try Next

- Use `Logic OR` in combination with **[Logic AND](/docs/agent-studio/components/logic/logical-and)** to build complex conditional flows, such as "(Condition A is true OR Condition B is true) AND Condition C is true."
- Use the output of a **[ForEach Loop](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)** to check if at least one item in a list met a certain criteria.
- Create a user validation flow that checks for an account ID OR an email address OR a phone number to identify a user.
