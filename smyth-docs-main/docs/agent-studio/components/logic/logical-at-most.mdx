# Logic At Most Component

Use the **Logic At Most** component to check that no more than a specified maximum number of inputs are `true`. This component is useful for setting upper limits and ensuring that a certain threshold is not exceeded.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Many processes require upper bounds or limits. The `Logic At Most` component is perfect for enforcing these rules, such as "trigger an alert only if at most 2 out of 10 services are offline" or "approve a request automatically if at most 1 flag is raised." It allows you to create workflows that can handle acceptable failure rates or tolerance levels gracefully.

## Step 1: Set the Maximum Limit

This is the core setting of the component. You define the maximum number of inputs that can be `true` for the "Verified" path to be taken.

| Setting          | Description                                                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Maximum Inputs** | Define the maximum number of inputs (from 0 to 9) that can have a `true` value to trigger the `Verified` output. |

### How Inputs are Evaluated
- **`True`**: Any input that has a value (e.g., a non-empty string, any number, the boolean `true`, an object, an array).
- **`False`**: Any input that is empty, `null`, `undefined`, or the boolean `false`.

## Step 2: Provide Inputs

You can add multiple inputs to the component, each representing a condition to be checked against the maximum limit.

| Action      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add Input** | Click the `+` icon to add a new input field. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the condition you are checking. |

## Step 3: Handle the Outputs

The component has two output branches, allowing you to direct the workflow based on whether the maximum limit was respected.

| Output       | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verified** | This path executes if the number of `true` inputs is **less than or equal to** the specified maximum.     |
| **Unverified** | This path executes if the number of `true` inputs is **greater than** the specified maximum.         |

<TipCallout title="Branching Your Workflow">
Connect the `Verified` output to the steps that should run when the condition is met (i.e., the limit was not exceeded). Connect the `Unverified` output to a path that handles the "too many" case, such as escalating to a human or logging a critical error.

## Best Practices

- **Enforce Business Rules:** Use this component to enforce rules like "a user can have at most 3 active sessions" or "a discount code can be applied to at most 1 promotional item."
- **Check for Low Error Rates:** In a quality control workflow, you could run several checks and use `Logic At Most` to pass an item if it has, for example, at most 2 minor defects.
- **Gatekeeping and Escalation:** Use this to automatically handle simple cases while escalating more complex ones. For example, "if at most 1 issue is detected, proceed; otherwise, create a support ticket."
- **Set Maximum to 0 for a NOR Gate:** If you set **Maximum Inputs** to `0`, this component behaves like a logical NOR gate, meaning the `Verified` path only runs if *all* inputs are `false`.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your logic isn't branching as expected...">
- **Check the Maximum Setting:** Ensure the `Maximum Inputs` value is set correctly for your use case.
- **Inspect Your Inputs:** Use the **Debug** panel to check the actual values being passed to each input. An input you believe is `false` might have an unexpected value (like the string "false"), causing it to be evaluated as `true`.
- **Verified vs. Unverified Path:** Double-check that you have connected your downstream components to the correct output path (`Verified` or `Unverified`) based on your intended logic.

## What to Try Next

- Use this component after a **[ForEach Loop](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)** to check that at most a certain number of items in the list failed processing.
- In a fraud detection system, check several risk indicators and use `Logic At Most` to allow a transaction if it triggers at most one low-level warning.
- Combine this with **[Logic At Least](/docs/agent-studio/components/logic/logical-at-least)** to check for a range, for example, "Verified if at least 2 AND at most 4 conditions are true."
