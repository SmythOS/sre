# Logic AND Component

Use the **Logic AND** component to verify that multiple conditions are all met simultaneously. This component acts as a gate, only allowing the workflow to proceed down the "Verified" path if every single one of its inputs evaluates to `true`.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Complex workflows often depend on multiple factors being true at once. The `Logic AND` component provides a simple, clear way to combine these conditions without building complex, nested `if` statements. It's essential for input validation, checking multiple permissions, or confirming that several preceding tasks have all completed successfully.

## Step 1: Understand the Logic

The component takes multiple inputs and provides two outputs: `Verified` and `Unverified`. The `Verified` path is only triggered if **all** inputs are `true`. If even one input is `false`, the `Unverified` path is triggered.

In this context:
- **`True`**: Any input that has a value (e.g., a non-empty string, any number, the boolean `true`, an object, an array).
- **`False`**: Any input that is empty, `null`, `undefined`, or the boolean `false`.

### Operational Rules

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Verified Path (Outputs `true`) | Unverified Path (Outputs `true`) |
|:--------|:--------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| `True`  | `True`  | **Active** | Inactive                         |
| `True`  | `False` | Inactive                       | **Active** |
| `False` | `True`  | Inactive                       | **Active** |
| `False` | `False` | Inactive                       | **Active** |

## Step 2: Provide Inputs

You can add two or more inputs to the component. These inputs will typically be connected to the outputs of previous components in your workflow.

| Action      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add Input** | Click the `+` icon to add a new input field. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the condition you are checking. |

## Step 3: Handle the Outputs

The component has two output branches, allowing you to direct the workflow based on whether all conditions were met.

| Output       | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verified** | This path executes if **all** inputs evaluate to `true`. It outputs the boolean value `true`.           |
| **Unverified** | This path executes if **any** of the inputs evaluate to `false`. It also outputs the boolean value `true`. |

<TipCallout title="Branching Your Workflow">
Connect the `Verified` output to the steps that should run when everything is correct. Connect the `Unverified` output to an error-handling path, like sending a notification or ending the workflow.

## Best Practices

- **Validate User Input:** Use `Logic AND` to ensure multiple required fields from a user form are all filled out before attempting to process the data.
- **Combine Status Checks:** If you run several `API Calls`, you can feed their success statuses into a `Logic AND` to confirm they all completed successfully before moving on.
- **Simplify Nested Conditions:** Instead of nesting multiple **Condition** components, use a single `Logic AND` component to check all conditions at once. This makes your workflow much cleaner and easier to read.
- **Name Your Inputs Clearly:** Give each input a descriptive name (e.g., `isUserAuthenticated`, `isPaymentSuccessful`) so you can easily understand the purpose of the logical check.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your logic isn't branching as expected...">
- **Check Your "False" Values:** Remember that an empty string (`""`), `null`, or an unassigned variable will be treated as `false`. Make sure a previous step isn't unintentionally producing an empty output.
- **Inspect Input Data:** Use the **Debug** panel to check the exact value being passed into each input of the `Logic AND` component to confirm they are what you expect.
- **It Only Takes One:** The `Unverified` path will be taken if even a single input is false. If the workflow is unexpectedly going down the "unverified" path, systematically check each input to find the one that is evaluating to `false`.

## What to Try Next

- Use `Logic AND` in combination with **[Logic OR](/docs/agent-studio/components/logic/logical-or)** and **[Logic XOR](/docs/agent-studio/components/logic/logical-xor)** to build complex conditional flows.
- Connect the outputs of several **[Classifier Components](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/classifier)** to a `Logic AND` to verify that a user's request meets multiple criteria.
- Place a `Logic AND` after a **[ForEach Loop](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)** to check if a specific condition was met for all items in the array.
