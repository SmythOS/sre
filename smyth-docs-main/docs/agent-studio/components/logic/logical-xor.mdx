# Logic XOR Component

Use the **Logic XOR** (Exclusive OR) component to verify that **exactly one** of multiple conditions is met. This component is essential for scenarios where choices are mutually exclusive, ensuring that only one option is valid at a time.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Many business rules require mutual exclusivity. The `Logic XOR` component enforces this by confirming that one, and only one, condition from a set is true. It's perfect for tasks like "allow a user to sign in with a username OR a phone number, but not both" or "process a transaction if it is marked as 'new' OR 'updated', but not neither or both."

## Step 1: Understand the Logic

The component takes multiple inputs and provides two outputs: `Verified` and `Unverified`. The `Verified` path is triggered only if **exactly one** input is `true`. In all other cases (zero `true` inputs, or more than one `true` input), the `Unverified` path is triggered.

In this context:
- **`True`**: Any input that has a value (e.g., a non-empty string, any number, the boolean `true`, an object, an array).
- **`False`**: Any input that is empty, `null`, `undefined`, or the boolean `false`.

### Operational Rules

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Verified Path (Outputs `true`) | Unverified Path (Outputs `true`) |
|:--------|:--------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| `True`  | `True`  | Inactive                       | **Active** |
| `True`  | `False` | **Active** | Inactive                         |
| `False` | `True`  | **Active** | Inactive                         |
| `False` | `False` | Inactive                       | **Active** |

## Step 2: Provide Inputs

You can add two or more inputs to the component, each representing a condition to be checked for mutual exclusivity.

| Action      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add Input** | Click the `+` icon to add a new input field. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the condition you are checking. |

## Step 3: Handle the Outputs

The component has two output branches, allowing you to direct the workflow based on whether exactly one condition was met.

| Output       | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verified** | This path executes if **one and only one** of the inputs evaluates to `true`.                             |
| **Unverified** | This path executes if zero inputs are true, or if more than one input is true.                           |

<TipCallout title="Branching Your Workflow">
Connect the `Verified` output to the main success path of your workflow. Connect the `Unverified` output to a path that handles the error case, such as asking the user to correct their input or logging an invalid state.

## Best Practices

- **Enforce Mutual Exclusivity:** This is the primary use case. Use it to ensure a user has selected only one option from a list, or that a data record exists in only one of several possible states.
- **Validate Configuration:** Check that a system is configured with exactly one of several possible settings enabled.
- **Distinguish from OR:** Do not confuse `XOR` with `OR`. `OR` succeeds if *at least one* condition is true. `XOR` succeeds only if *exactly one* condition is true.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your logic isn't branching as expected...">
- **The Unverified Path is Taken:** Remember that `Unverified` triggers in two cases: when no inputs are true, AND when more than one input is true. Use the **Debug** panel to inspect your inputs and see which case is occurring.
- **Check Your "False" Values:** An input you expect to be `false` might contain an unexpected value (like the string "false"), which evaluates to `true`, potentially causing more than one input to be true at once.
- **Inputs are Not Truly Exclusive:** If the `Unverified` path is frequently taken because multiple inputs are true, it may indicate a flaw in upstream logic that is allowing a non-exclusive state to occur.

## What to Try Next

- Create a sign-up flow where a user must provide either an email or a phone number, but not both, using `Logic XOR` to validate their input.
- In a state machine, use `Logic XOR` to confirm that an item is in exactly one state (e.g., "Pending" XOR "Complete" XOR "Failed").
- Combine with other logic components to build complex validation rules, such as "(`A` XOR `B` is true) AND `C` is also true."
