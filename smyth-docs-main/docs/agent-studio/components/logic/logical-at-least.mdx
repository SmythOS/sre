# Logic At Least Component

Use the **Logic At Least** component to check if a specific minimum number of inputs are `true`. This provides more flexibility than a simple AND or OR gate, allowing a workflow to proceed if a certain threshold of conditions is met.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Some decisions are not all-or-nothing. This component is perfect for scenarios where you need partial success, such as "proceed if at least 2 of 3 identity checks pass" or "trigger an alert if at least 5 of 10 servers are reporting errors." It allows you to build more nuanced and resilient workflows.

## Step 1: Set the Minimum Requirement

This is the core setting of the component. You define the minimum number of inputs that must be `true` for the "Verified" path to be taken.

| Setting          | Description                                                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Minimum Inputs** | Define the minimum number of inputs (from 0 to 9) that must have a `true` value to trigger the `Verified` output. |

### How Inputs are Evaluated
- **`True`**: Any input that has a value (e.g., a non-empty string, any number, the boolean `true`, an object, an array).
- **`False`**: Any input that is empty, `null`, `undefined`, or the boolean `false`.

## Step 2: Provide Inputs

You can add multiple inputs to the component, each representing a condition to be checked.

| Action      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add Input** | Click the `+` icon to add a new input field. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the condition you are checking. |

## Step 3: Handle the Outputs

The component has two output branches, allowing you to direct the workflow based on whether the minimum threshold was met.

| Output       | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verified** | This path executes if **at least** the specified minimum number of inputs evaluates to `true`.         |
| **Unverified** | This path executes if the number of `true` inputs is **less than** the specified minimum.              |

<TipCallout title="Branching Your Workflow">
Connect the `Verified` output to the steps that should run when the threshold is met. Connect the `Unverified` output to an alternative path or an error-handling flow.

## Best Practices

- **Check for Optional Data:** Use this component to verify that a user has submitted at least one of several optional pieces of information (e.g., "user provided at least a phone number OR an email address").
- **Tallying Approvals:** In a workflow that requires multiple approvals, you can use `Logic At Least` to proceed once a minimum number of approvers have responded positively.
- **Scoring and Thresholds:** Use this to check if a set of data meets a minimum quality score. For example, if you run 5 different validation checks, you might decide to proceed if at least 4 of them pass.
- **Set Minimum to 1 for an OR Gate:** If you set **Minimum Inputs** to `1`, this component behaves exactly like a **[Logic OR](/docs/agent-studio/components/logic/logical-or)** component.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your logic isn't branching as expected...">
- **Check the Minimum Setting:** Ensure the `Minimum Inputs` setting is correct. A common mistake is an "off-by-one" error where the number is one higher or lower than intended.
- **Inspect Your Inputs:** Use the **Debug** panel to check the actual values being passed to each input. An input you believe is `true` might actually be empty or `null`, causing it to be evaluated as `false`.
- **Verified vs. Unverified Path:** Make sure you have connected your downstream components to the correct output path (`Verified` or `Unverified`).

## What to Try Next

- Use this component to check if at least one of several possible contact methods (email, phone, SMS) provided by a user is valid.
- Combine this with a **[ForEach Loop](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)** to process a list of items and then check if at least a certain number of them returned a successful result.
- Chain multiple logic components together, for example, using a `Logic AND` to ensure critical inputs are present, and then a `Logic At Least` for optional ones.
