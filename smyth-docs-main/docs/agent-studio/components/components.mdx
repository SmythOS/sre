In SmythOS, components are the building blocks of your agent workflows. Each one represents a single task, skill, or utility, like calling an API, running logic, filtering JSON, generating text, or storing knowledge.

You build workflows by dragging components onto the canvas, connecting them visually, and configuring how data flows between them.

<InfoCallout title="What Components Do">
Components are modular logic blocks that do something specific inside an agent. You can connect them visually in the Builder, test them individually, and combine them to form powerful workflows.
</InfoCallout>

## Designing Logic with Components

Each pattern helps you control how your agent thinks and acts. You can combine components like Classifier, ForEach, or Async/Await to create dynamic, multi-step behaviors without writing code.

### Sequential Flow  
Run steps one after another.

**Use when:** Each step depends on the output of the previous  
**Example:** Generate blog → Summarize → Post to site  
**Useful components:**  
- [Code](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/code)  
- [Sleep](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/sleep)

### Branching Flow  
Choose a path based on logic or classification.

**Use when:** Your workflow must adapt to input data  
**Example:** If sentiment is negative, alert support; if positive, publish  
**Useful components:**  
- [Classifier](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/classifier)  
- [Code](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/code)

### Parallel Flow  
Run multiple tasks at the same time.

**Use when:** Tasks don’t depend on each other  
**Example:** Analyze text and extract entities in parallel  
**Useful components:**  
- [Async/Await](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/async)  
- [ForEach](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)

<InfoCallout title="Combine with care">
You can nest patterns. For example: run parallel tasks that each use sequential logic, or insert conditionals after a ForEach. For smarter control, combine flow patterns with components like: - **[Classifier](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/classifier)** – routes based on user intent - **[Code](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/code)** – runs custom logic.

### Choosing the Right Component  

| What You Want to Do            | Use This Component                                                                   | Why It Helps                                     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Loop through a list           | **[ForEach](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)**                       | Handles each item one by one                     |
| Run tasks at the same time    | **[Async/Await](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/async)**                      | Runs branches in parallel                        |
| Add a timed pause             | **[Sleep](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/sleep)**                            | Controls timing or rate limits                   |
| Store useful facts or context | **[RAG Remember](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-remember)**              | Saves info for later use in the workflow         |
| Route based on input type     | **[Classifier](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/classifier)**                      | Classifies input and picks the right path        |
| Transform or filter JSON      | **[JSON Filter](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/json-filter)**                | Modifies or extracts specific JSON data          |

<WarningCallout title="Keep workflows manageable">
If your flow grows large, split it into smaller Agent Skills and test each part before combining them.

## Why Components Matter

<InfoCallout title="The Power of Components">
Components are the building blocks of intelligent agents. They allow you to:
- Build complex workflows without writing code
- Create modular, maintainable agent architectures
- Leverage advanced AI capabilities through simple, controllable interfaces
- Scale your agents' capabilities as your needs grow
</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices
<WarningCallout title="Sensitive data handling">
Avoid storing secrets directly in components. Use the **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)** for secure access to keys and credentials.
</WarningCallout>

- Use clear component names and Notes to document your logic  
- Start simple, then layer in logic like loops or conditionals  
- Test individual components before combining them into larger flows  
- Use Agent Skills to break big flows into manageable pieces  
- For memory, use RAG components to store reusable facts 

## What to Try Next

- Explore the **[Workflow Guide](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/building-workflows)** to see how components come together  
- Learn how to **[Deploy Your Agent](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)**  
- Use a ready-made **[Agent Template](https://app.smythos.com/templates)** to build faster
