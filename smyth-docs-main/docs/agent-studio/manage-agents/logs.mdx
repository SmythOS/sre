# Logs
You can use logs to trace your agent’s behavior, troubleshoot issues, monitor performance, and audit activity. Logs show what ran, when it ran, and what happened at each step.
Logs help you:
- Diagnose agent failures
- Understand logic breakdowns
- Monitor API calls and data flows
- Track performance and execution timelines

<WarningCallout title="Log Retention by Plan">
Logs are automatically deleted based on your plan tier:
- **Free**: 7 days  
- **Builder / Startup**: 30 days  
- **Scaleup**: 90 days  
</WarningCallout>

## Where to Find Logs

You can access logs from two places:

- **From the Agent Dashboard**  
  Click on an agent card. This opens **Agent Settings**. From there, go to the **Logs** tab.

- **From Studio Canvas**  
  Click **Edit** on the agent card to open the Studio Canvas. In the left sidebar, go to **Settings → Logs**.

<InfoCallout>
Each log represents a complete run of an endpoint. Use it to trace the flow of data and decisions through your agent.

## Log Types

SmythOS captures several categories of logs:

| Log Type           | Description                                | Use Case                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Execution Logs** | Step-by-step breakdown of agent workflows  | Debug workflow logic        |
| **Performance Logs** | Timing and resource usage metrics       | Optimize agent efficiency   |
| **Error Logs**     | Failures and stack traces                  | Troubleshoot breakdowns     |
| **API Logs**       | Records of outgoing API calls              | Monitor third-party calls   |
| **Security Logs**  | Access attempts and auth activity          | Audit user access and roles |

## What You’ll See

Each log entry includes:

- **Timestamp** of execution  
- **Endpoint** that was called  
- **Input** data submitted  
- **Tags**, if triggered from the [Scheduler](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/tasks#scheduled-tasks)  
- **Execution Steps** showing each component, input, and output

Logs are shown in reverse chronological order.

## View a Specific Run

Click on any log row to open a detailed trace.

Each step will show:

- Component name  
- Type of component (e.g., API call, GenAI)  
- Input payload  
- Output payload  

You can download this log as a JSON file using the **Download Log** button.

## Visualize the Call Tree

To see how your agent executed step-by-step, use the **Show Call Tree** option.

1. Open a log entry
2. Click **Show Call Tree** in the first segment
3. A new window will show a visual map of your agent’s execution path

<TipCallout title="Tip">
Use the Call Tree to find silent failures or skipped branches in complex workflows.

## Debug With Logs

Logs work seamlessly with [Debug Mode](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging) on the canvas. Together, they help you:

- Verify agent logic  
- Compare expected vs actual outputs  
- Track component behavior across runs  

<InfoCallout>
For scheduled or bulk runs, follow the log link directly from the [Agent Tasks](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/tasks) tab.
</InfoCallout>

## Example API Log Request

You can test logs by triggering a run using an API request with a bearer token. Here’s a basic example:

```bash
curl https://your-agent.smythos.com/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123xyz789" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "hello"}'
```

Logs are especially useful when paired with analytics. For more details, visit [Analytics](/docs/agent-collaboration/analytics).

Use the call tree to quickly locate where logic breaks or unexpected outputs occur.
