# Manage Agents

Configure the agent's behavior, default LLM, manage embodiments, and customize its personality and capabilities. This is where you define how your agent acts, what it looks like, and how it responds during runtime.

Access your Agent Settings in the Agent Canvas by either, 
1. Clicking on the Agent Card OR
2. Selecting **Settings** form the left sidebar

You can update agent information, manage security and authentication, and view logs or schedule tasks from there.

## Configuration

Use this section to define the identity and behavior of your agent.

### Identity

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | The unique name used in UI and API requests. Choose something meaningful and descriptive. |
| **Avatar** | Auto-generated based on the name, or upload a custom image (recommended size: 256x256px). |
| **Description** | A short summary to describe the agent's purpose and use case. |

### Behavior Settings

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Default LLM** | Sets the primary language model used in chat and chatbot contexts. Affects response quality and reasoning. |
| **Behavior Description** | This acts as the system prompt. Describe what your agent knows, how it should behave, and any constraints or logic you want applied during generation. |

<InfoCallout>
Use the behavior description to guide the agent’s tone, structure, or persona. This affects every LLM-based response it gives.

## Global Variables
<TipCallout title="Non-sensitive values">
Use global variables for non-sensitive values that are shared across your agent’s workflow.
</TipCallout>
Global variables let you store reusable values for your workflows. They are accessible across all components inside your agent.

### Common Uses

- Shared API endpoints  
- Static parameters (e.g. `"language": "en-US"`)  
- Reused config values across components

<WarningCallout title="Use Vault for Secrets">
Do not store secrets or API keys in global variables. Use the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) instead to manage sensitive credentials securely.
</WarningCallout>
