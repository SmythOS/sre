  <summary>Why Integrate Meilisearch with Your Agent?</summary>

Meilisearch provides an incredibly fast and relevant search experience. By integrating it with SmythOS, you can automate the entire lifecycle of your search data.

- **Automated Indexing:** As new data is created in your applications (e.g., new products, users, or posts), agents can automatically add it to your Meilisearch indexes, ensuring your search results are always fresh.
- **Dynamic Content Management:** Agents can update or delete documents from your indexes based on events from other systems, keeping your search data perfectly in sync with your source of truth.
- **Intelligent Search Workflows:** Use the `Full Text Search` component to find information and use it in downstream steps. For example, find a user's profile ID to then fetch their full details from a database.
- **Streamline Maintenance:** Automate tasks like updating synonyms to continuously improve the relevance and quality of your search results without manual intervention.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A running **Meilisearch instance**, either self-hosted or on Meilisearch Cloud.
- The **Host URL** of your Meilisearch instance (e.g., `https://my-instance.meilisearch.com`).
- Your Meilisearch **Master Key**.

## Getting Started With Meilisearch

The connection between SmythOS and Meilisearch is configured using your instance's URL and a secure Master Key.

### Step 1: Locate Your Meilisearch Credentials
1.  **Host URL:** This is the main URL you use to access your Meilisearch instance.
2.  **Master Key:** In your Meilisearch instance, navigate to **Settings** -> **API Keys**. Your **Master Key** is displayed there. It has full permissions to perform any action.

### Step 2: Store Your Master Key in SmythOS Vault
Your Master Key is highly sensitive. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Meilisearch **Master Key** as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `meilisearch_master_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Meilisearch Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Meilisearch component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Master Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `meilisearch_master_key`).
4.  In the component's **Inputs**, provide the `url` of your Meilisearch instance.
5.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the `url` and `Master Key` to **each** Meilisearch component you use. This provides the flexibility to connect to different Meilisearch instances within the same agent.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Use the SmythOS Vault:** Your Meilisearch Master Key provides full administrative access. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault` and never expose it directly in your components.
* **Track Asynchronous Tasks:** Most write operations in Meilisearch (add, update, delete) are asynchronous and return a `taskUid`. You can build logic in your agent to poll the Meilisearch Tasks API with this UID to confirm when an operation has been successfully processed.
* **Batch Operations:** For indexing large amounts of data, always use the `Add Documents` component instead of `Add a Single Document` in a loop. Batching is significantly more performant.
* **Schema Design:** Before indexing, carefully design the schema for your documents. Deciding on a consistent `primaryKey` and which fields should be searchable or filterable is crucial for a good search experience.
* **Understand Filterable Attributes:** To filter search results (e.g., by price, category), you must first configure those attributes as "filterable" in your Meilisearch index settings. This is another task that can be automated with an agent.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The API key used is incorrect or does not have sufficient permissions.
  * **Solution:** Verify that you are using the **Master Key** (not a search-only key) and that it is correctly stored and referenced from the SmythOS Vault.

* **Error: `404 Not Found` for an index**
  * **Cause:** The `index_uid` you provided does not exist.
  * **Solution:** Double-check the spelling and case of your `index_uid`. You can use the Meilisearch Indexes API to list all existing indexes to confirm the name.

* **Error: `missing_document_id`**
  * **Cause:** You are trying to add a document that does not contain the field designated as the `primaryKey` for that index.
  * **Solution:** Ensure every document you send to Meilisearch includes the unique `primaryKey` field (e.g., `id`, `sku`, `objectID`).

* **Search results are not updating after adding documents**
  * **Cause:** Indexing is an asynchronous process. It might take a moment for new documents to become searchable.
  * **Solution:** Use the `taskUid` returned by write operations to check the status of the task. Only expect to find the document in search results after the task status is `succeeded`.

## What's Next?

You're now equipped to integrate lightning-fast search into your automated workflows with the **SmythOS Meilisearch Integration**!

Consider these next steps:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Syncs your entire user database from PostgreSQL into a "users" index every night.
    * Listens for new blog posts on a WordPress site and automatically adds them to a "posts" index for your website's search bar.
    * Connects to a product information system, updates the "products" index in real-time as inventory changes, and uses `Update Synonyms` to improve product discovery.
