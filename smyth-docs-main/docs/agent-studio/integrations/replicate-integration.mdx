  <summary>Why Integrate Replicate with Your Agent?</summary>

Replicate makes it incredibly simple to run a vast array of open-source machine learning models via a clean API. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to incorporate highly specialized AI capabilities into your workflows.

- **Access a Massive Model Library:** Go beyond standard text and image generation. Use models for video creation, music generation, image restoration, speech-to-text, and countless other specialized tasks.
- **Simplified AI Infrastructure:** Run complex models on powerful hardware without managing servers or worrying about dependencies. Replicate handles all the infrastructure for you.
- **Automate Creative Pipelines:** Chain Replicate models with other components. For example, use an AI text model to write a script, an Elevenlabs model to create a voiceover, and a Replicate model to generate a video.
- **Prototype and Scale:** Quickly experiment with different models to find the best one for your task. Replicate's pay-as-you-go pricing makes it easy to scale your usage as your needs grow.

- A **Replicate account**.
- Your Replicate **API Token**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Replicate

The connection between SmythOS and Replicate is configured using a secure API Token.

### Step 1: Get Your Replicate API Token
1.  Log in to your [Replicate account](https://replicate.com/).
2.  Navigate to your [Account settings](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) by clicking your profile icon.
3.  Your API token is displayed on this page. Copy it to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Token in SmythOS Vault
Your API Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Replicate API Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `replicate_api_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a Replicate Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Replicate component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `replicate_api_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Token from the Vault to **each** Replicate component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

</TipCallout>

<WarningCallout title="Essential Workflow Component">
All generative components on Replicate are asynchronous. You **must** use this component to fetch the result after starting a job.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider />

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Token:** Always store your Replicate API token in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Master the Asynchronous Flow:** The key to using Replicate is the two-step process. First, call a generative component to get a prediction `id`. Second, use the `Get Prediction` component (often in a loop with a delay) to poll for the final result. Check the `status` field in the response until it is "succeeded".
* **Check Model Inputs on Replicate:** Before using a new model, visit its page on the Replicate website and click the "API" tab. This will show you the exact structure and required parameters for the `input` object.
* **Use Public URLs:** For all components that take an image or audio file as input, the URL must be publicly accessible for Replicate's servers to download it.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Token is incorrect, invalid, or has been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Token in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your Replicate account settings.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** You have run out of funds in your Replicate account.
  * **Solution:** Check your billing status and add credits to your Replicate account.

* **Prediction Fails or is Stuck "processing"**
  * **Cause:** The model may have encountered an error with your specific input, or there could be a temporary issue with the model on Replicate's side.
  * **Solution:** Check the `error` field in the response from the `Get Prediction` component for a detailed message. Try a different, simpler input to see if the model is working. Check the Replicate status page for any known issues.

* **Incorrect Input Error**
  * **Cause:** The JSON object passed as the `input` does not match the schema the model expects.
  * **Solution:** Go to the model's page on Replicate and carefully review the "API" tab. Ensure every parameter name and data type in your input matches their example exactly.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build agents with a virtually limitless set of AI capabilities using the **SmythOS Replicate Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Creates a full video short. It uses an LLM to write a script, [Elevenlabs](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/elevenlabs-integration) to generate a voiceover, a Replicate text-to-image model to create scenes, and a Replicate image-to-video model to animate them.
    * Acts as an "image expert." A user provides an image URL, and the agent uses `Answer Image Questions` to describe it, `Face Restoration` to enhance it, and `Background Remover` to create a cutout version.
    * Transcribes a podcast episode using the `openai/whisper` model on Replicate, then uses an LLM from [OpenRouter](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to generate show notes and chapter timestamps.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Generate images with Replicate and store them in [OneDrive](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/onedrive-integration) or another cloud storage service.
    * Use Replicate's speech-to-text models to process audio from customer support calls, then log the transcript as a note in [GoHighLevel](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/gohighlevel-integration) or [HubSpot](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/hubspot-integration).
