  <summary>Why Integrate PlayHT with Your Agent?</summary>

PlayHT is a leader in AI voice generation, offering a wide range of realistic voices and emotional tones. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build sophisticated, multi-sensory automations.

- **Automate Audio Content:** Create agents that automatically convert blog posts, news articles, or reports into audio podcasts, enhancing content accessibility.
- **Personalized Audio Messages:** Generate dynamic, personalized audio alerts or messages at scale. Imagine an agent that greets users by name in a welcome message.
- **Create Voiceovers on the Fly:** Build a media pipeline where an agent writes a script with an LLM, then immediately generates a voiceover for a video or presentation using PlayHT.
- **Enhance Notifications:** Move beyond simple text alerts. Configure your agents to generate spoken notifications for critical system events, providing a more immediate and attention-grabbing alert.

Your User ID and Secret Key are sensitive credentials. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret for your `User ID` and another for your `Secret Key`. Give them memorable names, like `playht_user_id` and `playht_secret_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a PlayHT Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any PlayHT component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `User ID` and `Secret Key` fields, select the corresponding secrets you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the User ID and Secret Key from the Vault to **each** PlayHT component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which PlayHT Component Should I Use?

| If you need to… | Workflow Steps | Use these Components | Why these? |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Generate high-quality, emotional speech** | 1. Start Job <br/> 2. Fetch Result | [PlayHT 2.0 - TTS](#playht-20---tts) → [Get Output](#get-output) | The 2.0 TTS engine offers superior quality and emotional control, but requires a two-step, asynchronous process. |
| **Generate standard speech quickly** | 1. Start Job <br/> 2. Fetch Result | [PlayHT 1.0 - TTS](#playht-10---tts) → [Get Output](#get-output) | The 1.0 TTS engine is suitable for basic voice generation without the need for advanced emotional tones. |
| **Retrieve a previously generated audio file** | Fetch Result | [Get Output](#get-output) | This is the essential second step to get the audio URL from any TTS job you've started. |

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each PlayHT component.

### <a name="playht-20---tts"></a>PlayHT 2.0 - TTS
Initiates a text-to-speech conversion job using PlayHT's advanced v2.0 engine, which supports emotional tones. This is an asynchronous operation.

<InfoCallout>This component requires a `User ID` and `Secret Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-playht) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Component-Specific Settings
- **Output Format:** Choose the audio format (`mp3`, `wav`, `ogg`, etc.).
- **Quality:** Select the output quality, from `draft` to `premium`.
- **Emotion:** Select a specific emotional tone for the voice (e.g., `female_happy`, `male_angry`).
- **Speed, Sample Rate, Voice Guidance, Style Guidance:** Fine-tune the voice performance with these sliders.

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | Yes | The text content to convert into speech. |
| `voice_id` | string | Yes | The ID of the voice to use. You can find voice IDs in your PlayHT Studio. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | The unique ID of the conversion job. This is crucial for the next step. |
| `Response`| object | The raw JSON response from the PlayHT API confirming the job was started. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
An agent generates a voiceover for an animated character. It passes the character's line of dialogue to this component and selects the `female_surprised` emotion. The agent then saves the output `id`.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "playht.playht20Tts",
  "text": "Wow, I can't believe SmythOS can automate this!",
  "voice_id": "s3_voice_id_example"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Asynchronous Job">
This component only **starts** the audio generation job. It does **not** return the final audio file. You must use the output `id` with the "Get Output" component to retrieve the result.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="get-output"></a>Get Output
Retrieves the result of a TTS conversion job that has been initiated by either the v1.0 or v2.0 TTS component.

<InfoCallout>This component requires a `User ID` and `Secret Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-playht) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | The unique ID of the conversion job, obtained from the output of a TTS component. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `URL` | string | The direct URL to the generated audio file once processing is complete. |
| `Response`| object | The raw JSON response from the API, which includes the status of the job and the URL. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
After starting a TTS job and getting an `id`, an agent uses this component in a loop with a short delay, checking the status in the `Response` until the `URL` is available, then downloads the file.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "playht.getOutput",
  "id": "tts-job-id-from-previous-step"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Processing Time">
Audio generation is not instantaneous. You may need to call this component a few seconds after the TTS job is started. Check the `Response` for the job status (`"transcoded": true`) before using the `URL`.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="playht-10---tts"></a>PlayHT 1.0 - TTS
Initiates a text-to-speech conversion job using PlayHT's standard v1.0 engine.

<InfoCallout>This component requires a `User ID` and `Secret Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-playht) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Component-Specific Settings
- **Output Format:** Choose the audio format (`mp3`, `wav`, etc.).
- **Quality:** Select the output quality, from `draft` to `premium`.

| `Response`| object | The raw JSON response from the PlayHT API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
An agent generates a simple, neutral-tone audio notification, like "Your report has finished generating."
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "playht.playht10Tts",
  "text": "System alert. Server utilization has reached 90 percent.",
  "voice_id": "s3_voice_id_example"
}
```

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always store your `User ID` and `Secret Key` in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Master the Asynchronous Flow:** The key to using this integration effectively is the two-step process. First, call a TTS component to get a job `id`. Second, use the `Get Output` component (potentially in a loop with a delay) to fetch the final audio `URL`.
* **Experiment with Voices and Settings:** PlayHT offers a huge variety of voices. Spend time in the PlayHT Studio to find the ones that best fit your brand. Tweak the speed, quality, and emotion settings to get the perfect performance.
* **Manage Your Quota:** Text-to-speech conversion consumes characters from your PlayHT plan. Be mindful of the length of the text you are converting, especially in high-volume automated workflows.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The `User ID` or `Secret Key` is incorrect or missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that your credentials in the SmythOS Vault are correct and match those on your PlayHT API Access page.

* **"Get Output" returns a "Pending" status**
  * **Cause:** The audio generation job is not yet complete.
  * **Solution:** This is normal. Add a delay (e.g., 5-10 seconds) in your agent between the TTS component and the `Get Output` component. For long texts, you may need a longer delay or a looping mechanism.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** You have exceeded your character quota for the month or have an issue with your PlayHT subscription.
  * **Solution:** Check your account status and usage in your PlayHT dashboard.

* **Poor Audio Quality or Incorrect Emotion**
  * **Cause:** The selected settings may not be optimal for the voice or text.
  * **Solution:** Try a different `Quality` setting in the component. Adjust the `Style Guidance` and `Voice Guidance` sliders in the v2.0 component to fine-tune the performance.
