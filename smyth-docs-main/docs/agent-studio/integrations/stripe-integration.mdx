  <summary>Why Integrate Stripe with Your Agent?</summary>

Stripe is a leading platform for online payment processing. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that manage the financial aspects of your business.

- **Automate Customer Creation:** When a new user signs up for your application or makes their first purchase, an agent can automatically create a corresponding customer object in Stripe, ready for billing.
- **Streamline Billing Workflows:** Build agents that can create invoices, manage subscriptions, or process one-time charges by interacting with the Stripe API (via custom API components or future enhancements).
- **Sync Financial Data:** Keep your internal systems up-to-date. An agent can be triggered by a new payment in Stripe (via webhooks) and then update a record in your CRM or accounting software.
- **Automate Dunning and Collections:** Create agents that check for failed payments and automatically trigger a workflow to notify the customer via email and prompt them to update their payment information.

- A **Stripe account**.
- Your Stripe **Secret API Key**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Stripe

The connection between SmythOS and Stripe is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Stripe API Secret Key
1.  Log in to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).
2.  Navigate to the **Developers** section in the top-right corner.
3.  In the left menu, click on **API Keys**.
4.  You will see your **Standard keys**. For most integrations, you will use the **Secret key**.
5.  Click the **Reveal live key** or **Reveal test key** button.
6.  Copy the secret key (`sk_...`) to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Secret Key is a highly sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Stripe API Secret Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `stripe_secret_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Stripe Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Stripe component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Secret` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `stripe_secret_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Secret from the Vault to **each** Stripe component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Stripe Component Should I Use?

| If you need toâ€¦ | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Create a new billing profile** for a user | Customer data (e.g., email, name) | [Create Customer](#create-customer) | The standard method for creating a new customer object in Stripe before you can charge them. |
| **Look up a customer's details** using their ID | A `customer_id` | [Get Customer](#get-stripe-customer) | The primary way to retrieve a specific customer's full record from Stripe. |

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each Stripe component.

### <a name="create-customer"></a>Create Customer
Creates a new customer object in your Stripe account.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Secret` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-stripe) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Component-Specific Settings
- **Body:** A JSON editor where you define the new customer's details, such as `email`, `name`, or `description`.

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `trigger` | any | Yes | Any input value can be used to trigger the component's execution. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `customerId`| string | The unique ID of the newly created customer (e.g., `cus_...`). |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Stripe API, containing the complete customer object. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
When a new user signs up for a free trial on your website, an agent takes their email and name and uses this component to create a customer record in Stripe, ready for when they decide to upgrade to a paid plan.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "stripe.createCustomer",
  "trigger": "true",
  "Body": {
    "email": "jenny.rosen@example.com",
    "name": "Jenny Rosen"
  }
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Body Schema">
The `Body` payload must follow the structure defined in the Stripe API documentation for creating a customer. You can include many optional fields like `address`, `phone`, and `metadata`.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="get-stripe-customer"></a>Get Customer
Retrieves the details of an existing customer by their unique Stripe customer ID.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Secret` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-stripe) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `customer_id`| string | Yes | The unique identifier of the customer to retrieve (e.g., `cus_...`). |

#### Outputs

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
A customer service agent needs to check a user's subscription status. The agent takes the user's customer ID from a CRM, uses this component to fetch their Stripe record, and then checks the subscription details within the `Response` object.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "stripe.getStripeCustomer",
  "customer_id": "cus_ABC123XYZ456"
}
```

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Your Stripe Secret Key grants full access to your account's data and operations. **Always** store it in the SmythOS `Vault` and never expose it.
* **Use Test Mode:** When developing and testing your agents, use your **Test** API keys from the Stripe Dashboard. Only switch to your **Live** API keys for your production agents.
* **Leverage Metadata:** The `metadata` field on many Stripe objects (like Customer) is a powerful tool. Use it to store your application's internal IDs (e.g., your user ID) on the Stripe object. This makes it easy to link a Stripe customer back to a user in your own database.
* **Handle Errors Gracefully:** The Stripe API provides clear error codes and messages. Design your agents to handle common errors, such as a declined card when creating a payment, by parsing the `Response` object.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Secret Key is incorrect, has been revoked, or you are using a Test key for a Live request (or vice-versa).
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Secret in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Ensure you are using the correct key (Test vs. Live) for the environment you are targeting.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The ID provided (e.g., `customer_id`) does not exist.
  * **Solution:** Double-check the ID for typos. Ensure the customer record exists in the Stripe environment (Test or Live) that you are querying.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / Invalid Parameter**
  * **Cause:** The JSON `Body` for a create operation is malformed or contains an invalid value for a parameter.
  * **Solution:** Carefully check your JSON structure against the official Stripe API documentation. For example, ensure the `email` field is a valid email address.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful financial and e-commerce automations with the **SmythOS Stripe Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Manages the full new user lifecycle. When a user signs up in [Firebase Auth](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firebase-integration), the agent creates a corresponding customer in Stripe and a user profile in your [Firestore](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firestore-integration) database.
    * Automates invoicing. The agent retrieves a list of monthly active users, generates an invoice for each one using the Stripe API (via a custom API component), and then sends them an email notification using [Resend](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/resend-integration).
    * Handles failed payments. When a subscription payment fails (triggered by a Stripe webhook), an agent sends a notification to the customer via SMS using [Twilio](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/twilio-integration) and creates a follow-up task in [Asana](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/asana-integration) for the customer success team.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use Stripe as a trigger. A Stripe webhook can notify your agent of a new purchase, which then grants the user access to a specific course or product.
    * Log every new Stripe customer or transaction to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for custom, real-time financial reporting.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.
