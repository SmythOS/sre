## Getting Started With Leia Inc.

The connection between SmythOS and Leia Inc. is handled via OAuth 2.0, which requires a Client ID and Client Secret.

### Step 1: Get Your Leia API Credentials
1.  Log in to your [Leiapix account](https://leiapix.com/).
2.  Navigate to the API keys or client credentials section of your account dashboard. You can typically find it at `https://auth.leialoft.com/auth/realms/leialoft/account/client-credentials`.
3.  Your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed. Copy both of these values.

### Step 2: Store Your Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your Client ID and Secret are sensitive credentials. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret for your `Client ID` and another for your `Client Secret`. Give them memorable names, like `leia_client_id` and `leia_client_secret`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Leia Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Leia component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields, select the corresponding secrets you saved in the Vault.
4.  Click the `Authenticate` button to initiate the connection.
5.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Client ID and Secret from the Vault to **each** Leia component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your Leia `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
* **Create a Full Pipeline:** The most effective way to use this integration is to chain the three components together: 1. Get URL for disparity map. 2. Generate disparity map. 3. Get URL for animation. 4. Generate animation.
* **Experiment with Settings:** The visual quality and style of your animation depend heavily on the settings in the "Generate Animation" component. Test different values for `Amplitude` and `Animation Length` to achieve the desired effect.
* **Image Quality Matters:** Start with a high-quality, clear 2D image for the best results. Images with a clear foreground and background tend to produce more dramatic 3D effects.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The `Client ID` or `Client Secret` is invalid, or the authentication token has expired.
  * **Solution:** Verify that your credentials in the SmythOS Vault are correct. Try re-authenticating the component in the settings panel.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request`**
  * **Cause:** A required input URL (e.g., `inputImageUrl`, `resultPresignedUrl`) is missing, malformed, or inaccessible.
  * **Solution:** Ensure all URL inputs are valid and publicly accessible. For `resultPresignedUrl` inputs, make sure you are passing a valid URL obtained from the "Get Pre-Signed URL" component.

* **Animation/Disparity Map Fails to Generate**
  * **Cause:** The source image may be too complex, in an unsupported format, or the URL may be invalid. The pre-signed URL may have expired.
  * **Solution:** Try a different source image. Verify the image URL is correct and accessible. Ensure your entire workflow runs within the 24-hour expiration window of the pre-signed URLs.

## What's Next?

You're now ready to build automated 3D content pipelines with the **SmythOS Leia Inc. Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Watches a folder in a cloud storage service. When a new 2D product image is added, the agent automatically runs the full Leia pipeline to create a 3D animation and saves it to a different "Completed" folder.
    * Takes a list of image URLs from a Google Sheet, iterates through each one, generates a 3D animation, and writes the final animation URL back to the sheet in a new column.
    * Connects to a social media scheduler, generates a 3D animation from a static image, and then uploads it as a new post.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use the [ScrapingBee Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/scrapingbee-integration) to find images on a website, then use Leia to convert them to 3D.
    * Generate an image with an AI model like [Fal.ai](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/falai-integration) and then bring it to life with Leia's animation tools.
    * Store your final animation files in [OneDrive](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/onedrive-integration) or another cloud storage service for long-term keeping.
