  <summary>Why Integrate Jira with Your Agent?</summary>

Jira is the central nervous system for countless development teams. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that connect your project management directly to your other business and development tools.

- **Automated Issue Creation:** Create agents that listen for triggers—a new bug report from a customer support tool, a critical alert from a monitoring service, or a new feature request from a product board—and automatically create a corresponding, well-structured issue in the correct Jira project.
- **Streamlined Workflows:** Build agents that move issues through your workflow automatically. When a pull request is merged in GitHub, an agent can find the linked Jira issue and use `Transition Issue` to move it from "In Review" to "Done".
- **Intelligent Triage and Assignment:** An agent can analyze an incoming bug report, use an LLM to determine its likely priority and component, `Label Jira Issue` accordingly, and then `Assign Issue` to the appropriate team lead.
- **Data Synchronization:** Keep other systems in sync with Jira. When an issue is updated, an agent can post a notification to a Slack channel or update the status in an external project management tool.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Jira Cloud** instance.
- An **Atlassian account** with permissions to access the desired Jira projects.
- An **API Token** generated from your Atlassian account.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Jira Cloud

The connection is handled via Basic Authentication, which requires your user email and an API token, combined and encoded in Base64 format.

### Step 1: Generate a Jira API Token
1.  Log in to your [Atlassian Account](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
2.  Click **Create API token**.
3.  Give your token a memorable label (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and click **Create**.
4.  **Copy the generated API Token immediately.** It will not be shown again.

### Step 2: Encode Your Credentials in Base64
1.  Combine your Atlassian account email and the API Token into a single string with a colon in between: `your-email@example.com:YourAPIToken`.
2.  Use a Base64 encoding tool (like the "Encode/Decode" component in SmythOS) to encode this entire string.
3.  Copy the resulting Base64 encoded string.

### Step 3: Store Your Encoded Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your encoded credentials are a sensitive secret. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your **Base64 encoded string** as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `jira_base64_auth`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 4: Configure a Jira Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Jira component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Base 64 Encoded User Email and API Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Base64 encoded secret from the Vault to each Jira component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Jira Component Should I Use?

| If you need to… | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Create a new bug report** | A project key and summary | [Create Issue](#create-issue) | The primary method for programmatically creating new issues. |
| **Move a task to "In Progress"** | An issue key and a transition ID | [Transition Issue](#transition-issue) | The correct way to change an issue's workflow status. |
| **Find the ID for the "Done" status**| An issue key | [Get Transitions](#get-transitions) | This is a prerequisite for `Transition Issue`, as it gives you the valid `transitionId`. |
| **Assign a bug** to a developer | An issue key and an account ID | [Assign Issue](#assign-issue) | The standard way to set or change the assignee of an issue. |
| **Find a user's ID** to assign them a task | A user's name or email | [Find Users](#find-users) | The best way to get a user's `accountId` needed for assignments. |
| **Add a "customer-reported" tag** | An issue key and a label | [Label Jira Issue](#label-jira-issue) | Allows for programmatic categorization of your issues. |

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Your `useremail:api_token` string is a direct credential. Always Base64 encode it and store the result in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand the Workflow:** Many Jira actions are multi-step. To change an issue's status, you must first `Get Transitions` to find the correct ID, then `Transition Issue`. To assign an issue, you may need to `Find Users` first to get their `accountId`.
* **Use JQL for Advanced Searches:** While not a dedicated component, Jira's power comes from JQL (Jira Query Language). You can use a generic API component in SmythOS to make calls to Jira's `/rest/api/3/search` endpoint with a JQL query for highly specific searches.
* **Custom Fields:** To update custom fields on an issue, you will need to use the `Update Issue` endpoint with a custom JSON body. This typically requires a generic API call component where you construct the full payload according to the Jira REST API documentation.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Base64 encoded `useremail:api_token` string is incorrect, or the user's account does not have access. The API token may have been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Carefully re-create and re-encode your credential string. Ensure the user email is correct and the API token is valid in your Atlassian account settings.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The authenticated user does not have the necessary project permissions to perform the action (e.g., trying to create an issue in a project they can't access).
  * **Solution:** Check the user's project role and permission scheme directly in Jira.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect `domain_name`, `issue_key`, or `project_key` was provided.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all identifiers for typos. Ensure the issue or project exists and the user has permission to view it.

* **"Transition is not available" Error**
  * **Cause:** You are attempting to use a `transitionId` that is not valid for the issue's current status in the workflow.
  * **Solution:** Always call the `Get Transitions` component for the specific issue right before you attempt to transition it to get the list of currently available transitions.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful development and project management workflows with the **SmythOS Jira Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a bridge to your customer support tool. When a support ticket is escalated to "bug," the agent automatically creates a linked Jira issue. When the Jira issue is marked "Done," the agent posts an internal note back on the support ticket.
    * Manages your release process. When a developer merges a PR into the `release` branch in [GitHub](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/github-integration), an agent finds all related Jira issues and transitions them to a "Ready for Release" status.
    * Creates a daily stand-up report by fetching all issues assigned to a specific user that were updated in the last 24 hours and sending a summary to a [Microsoft Teams](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/microsoft-teams-integration) channel.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a new issue is created, send a notification to a [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration) or [Discord](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/discord-integration) channel.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to summarize a long customer email, then use that summary as the description when creating a Jira issue.
    * Connect Jira to a time-tracking tool, automatically creating log entries based on issue transitions.
