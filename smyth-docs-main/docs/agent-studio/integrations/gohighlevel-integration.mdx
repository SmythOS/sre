  <summary>Why Integrate GoHighLevel with Your Agent?</summary>

GoHighLevel is an all-in-one platform for marketing and sales. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful, end-to-end automations that connect every part of your business.

- **Automate Lead Capture and Nurturing:** Create agents that capture leads from any source (web forms, social media, ads) and instantly create a `Contact` in GoHighLevel, add them to a `Workflow`, and create a sales `Opportunity`.
- **Streamline Sales Operations:** Build an agent that, when a deal is moved to a new stage in your pipeline, automatically creates and assigns a `Task` to the sales rep, such as "Send follow-up email."
- **Data Synchronization:** Keep your GoHighLevel CRM perfectly in sync with your other business tools. An agent can update contact information in GoHighLevel whenever it changes in your accounting software or e-commerce platform.
- **Centralized Task Management:** Use agents to create tasks in GoHighLevel based on events from other applications, ensuring all your team's to-dos are in one place.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **GoHighLevel account**.
- A GoHighLevel **API Key** (either for a specific Location or for your entire Agency).

<Divider />

## Getting Started With GoHighLevel

The connection between SmythOS and GoHighLevel is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your GoHighLevel API Key
GoHighLevel has two types of keys. Choose the one that fits your needs:
- **Location API Key:** For accessing data within a single sub-account.
    1. Log in to your GoHighLevel dashboard and switch to the desired **sub-account**.
    2. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys** (under the "Business Info" section in some views).
    3. Click to generate or copy your Location API Key.
- **Agency API Key:** For agency-level access across multiple sub-accounts.
    1. From your main Agency dashboard, go to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
    2. Here you can find your Agency API Key.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your GoHighLevel API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `gohighlevel_location_key` or `gohighlevel_agency_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a GoHighLevel Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any GoHighLevel component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the API Key field, select the secret you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** GoHighLevel component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Keys:** Always store your GoHighLevel API Keys in the SmythOS `Vault`. Remember that Location keys and Agency keys have different levels of access.
* **Understand the GHL Hierarchy:** GoHighLevel is structured into Agencies, which contain Locations (sub-accounts). Most day-to-day operations (like managing contacts and opportunities) happen at the Location level and require a Location API Key.
* **Use Search Before Create:** To avoid creating duplicate contacts, it's a best practice to use the `Search Contact By Email` component first. If no contact is found, then proceed to `Create Contact`.
* **Dynamic Workflows:** Use the "Get" components (like `Get Pipelines` or `Get All Tags`) to programmatically find the IDs you need for "Create" or "Update" actions, making your agents more robust and less reliant on hardcoded IDs.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, invalid, or you are using a Location key for an Agency-level endpoint (or vice-versa).
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct. Ensure you are using the appropriate key type (Location vs. Agency) for the component you are using.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect ID was provided (e.g., `list_id`, `contactId`, `pipelineId`).
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Use the "Get" or "List" components to verify that the resource you are trying to access exists.

* **Contact/Opportunity Not Created**
  * **Cause:** A required field may be missing, or the data may be in an invalid format.
  * **Solution:** Check all required inputs for the component. For example, the `status` for an opportunity must be one of "open", "won", or "lost". Examine the `Response` output for detailed error messages from the GoHighLevel API.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful sales and marketing automations with the **SmythOS GoHighLevel Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Manages the entire lead-to-customer pipeline. It captures a lead from a form, creates a `Contact`, creates an `Opportunity`, adds the contact to a `Workflow`, and creates a follow-up `Task` for a sales rep.
    * Syncs data with your accounting software. When an opportunity's status is updated to "won" in GoHighLevel, an agent creates a new customer and a draft invoice in your accounting platform.
    * Acts as a lead qualification bot. It engages with a new lead via an automated chat or email sequence, asks qualifying questions, and then updates the contact's custom fields and tags in GoHighLevel based on their answers.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a new contact is created in GoHighLevel, trigger an agent to also add them to a specific email list in [Mailchimp](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/mailchimp-integration) or [Klaviyo](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/klaviyo-integration).
    * Connect GoHighLevel to a payment processor like [Stripe](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/stripe-integration). When a new customer is created in Stripe, create or update the corresponding contact in GoHighLevel.
    * Use a scheduling tool integration to book appointments, then create a contact and a follow-up task in GoHighLevel for that appointment.
