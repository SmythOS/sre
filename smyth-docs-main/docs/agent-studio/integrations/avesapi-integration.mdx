## Getting Started With AvesAPI

The connection between SmythOS and AvesAPI is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your AvesAPI API Key
1.  Log in to your [AvesAPI account](https://app.avesapi.com/).
2.  Navigate to your [profile page](https://app.avesapi.com/profile/).
3.  Your **API Key** is displayed on this page. Copy it.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your AvesAPI Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your AvesAPI API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `avesapi_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure the AvesAPI Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Google Web Search** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `avesapi_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to each AvesAPI component you use. This provides granular control and ensures all connections are secure.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the AvesAPI component.

### <a name="google-web-search"></a>Google Web Search
Retrieves real-time Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) data for a given query, handling all proxies and CAPTCHAs automatically.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-avesapi) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `query` | <Badge type="required" /> | The keyword or phrase to search for on Google. |
| `google_country_code` | <Badge type="optional" /> | Two-letter country code for localized results (e.g., `de` for Germany). Default: `us`. |
| `google_ui_language` | <Badge type="optional" /> | Two-letter language code for the UI (e.g., `es` for Spanish). Default: `en`. |
| `google_domain` | <Badge type="optional" /> | The Google domain to use (e.g., `google.co.uk`). Default: `google.com`. |
| `num` | <Badge type="optional" /> | The number of search results to return (e.g., `100`). Default: `10`. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `organic_results` | An array of objects, each representing a standard, non-paid search result. |
| `response`| The raw JSON response from the AvesAPI, including all SERP features found. |
| `headers` | HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
Create a rank-tracking agent. Schedule it to run daily, search for your target keyword, loop through the `organic_results`, and find your website's position. Log the position and date to a Google Sheet to monitor performance over time.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "avesapi.googleWebSearch",
  "query": "SmythOS no-code automation",
  "google_country_code": "us",
  "num": 20
}
```

<WarningCallout title="API Usage">
Each query consumes credits from your AvesAPI account. Higher `num` values or more frequent queries will increase consumption.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Your AvesAPI key is a credential. Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.
* **Refine Your Queries:** Use specific country and language codes to get the most accurate SERP data for your target audience.
* **Parse the `response` Output:** The `organic_results` output is convenient, but the full `response` object contains a wealth of extra information, such as "People Also Ask," "Related Searches," and "Knowledge Graph" data that can be used for more advanced analysis.
* **Handle Errors:** While AvesAPI handles common scraping issues, network errors can still occur. Build error-handling logic into your agent to manage failed requests gracefully.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API key is invalid, missing, or has been disabled.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your AvesAPI profile. Ensure your AvesAPI account is active.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** You have run out of credits in your AvesAPI account.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your AvesAPI dashboard to check your credit balance and top up if necessary.

* **Empty `organic_results` Array**
  * **Cause:** The query may have genuinely returned no organic results for the specified parameters, or the query itself was blocked for other reasons.
  * **Solution:** Test the query in your browser to ensure it's valid. Check the full `response` object for any error messages or details from AvesAPI.

## What's Next?

You're now ready to build powerful, data-driven workflows with the **SmythOS AvesAPI Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Monitors Google Search for mentions of your brand, extracts the URL and snippet, and sends a daily summary to a Slack channel.
    * Performs a search for a list of competitor domains and analyzes their top-ranking pages to identify content gaps.
    * Gathers the top 10 results for a "how-to" query and feeds them to an AI component to generate a comprehensive, summarized answer.
