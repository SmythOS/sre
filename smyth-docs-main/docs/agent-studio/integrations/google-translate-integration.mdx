  <summary>Why Integrate Google Translate with Your Agent?</summary>

Google Translate is a world-class machine translation service. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build agents that operate globally and understand user input regardless of language.

- **Automate Multilingual Support:** Automatically detect the language of an incoming customer support ticket or email, translate it to your team's native language, and then translate your team's response back to the customer's language.
- **Global Content Workflows:** Create agents that can take content in one language and automatically translate it into several others for international websites or marketing campaigns.
- **Data Processing and Analysis:** Process unstructured text data from various global sources by first standardizing it into a single language for easier analysis, sentiment tracking, or classification.
- **Enhanced User Interaction:** Build chatbots or interactive agents that can seamlessly switch languages based on the user's input, providing a more natural and inclusive user experience.

    * Copy both values immediately.

    <WarningCallout title="Secure Your Credentials!">
    Your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` are sensitive. Store them securely in the SmythOS `Vault`. [Learn more here.](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)
    </WarningCallout>

### Step 2: Authenticate in SmythOS
1.  **Add a Google Translate Component:** Drag any Google Translate component onto your agent graph in SmythOS.
2.  **Enter Credentials:**
    * Click the component to open its **Settings**.
    * Input the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you just copied (or reference them from the Vault).
3.  **Authorize the Connection:**
    * Click the `Authenticate` button.
    * You'll be redirected to a Google sign-in page. Log in and grant the requested permissions.
    * You will be redirected back to SmythOS, and the integration will show as connected.

<InfoCallout title="One-Time Setup" collapsible >
Once you authenticate, the connection is saved for your SmythOS account. You won't need to re-enter credentials for other Google Translate components.

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each Google Translate component.

### <a name="translate-text"></a>Translate Text
Translates one or more strings of text into a specified target language.

<InfoCallout>This component uses the OAuth 2.0 flow detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-google-translate) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | string | Yes | Your numeric Google Cloud Project ID. |
| `text` | array | Yes | An array of text strings to be translated. |
| `targetLanguageCode` | string | Yes | The ISO-639-1 code for the target language (e.g., `es` for Spanish, `fr` for French). |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `translations`| array | An array of objects, each containing a `translatedText` field. The order matches the input `text` array. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Google Translate API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
An agent receives an email, uses "Detect Language" to identify it as Spanish, then uses this component to translate the body to English for an English-speaking support team.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "googleTranslate.translateText",
  "project_id": "your-gcp-project-id",
  "text": [
    "Hello, world!",
    "How are you?"
  ],
  "targetLanguageCode": "de"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="API Costs">
Google's Translation API is a paid service. Each character translated will count against your Google Cloud project's billing.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="detect-language"></a>Detect Language
Analyzes a string of text and determines the language it is written in. (This component was formerly referred to as "Language Code Validator").

<InfoCallout>This component uses the OAuth 2.0 flow detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-google-translate) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | string | Yes | Your numeric Google Cloud Project ID. |
| `content` | string | Yes | The text content whose language you want to detect. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `languageCode` | string | The ISO-639-1 code of the most likely language detected. |
| `Response`| object | The full API response, which includes a list of detected languages and their confidence scores. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
Build an intelligent ticket routing system. An agent uses this component to detect the language of an incoming support request and then adds a corresponding tag (e.g., "language-french") before assigning it to the appropriate regional team.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "googleTranslate.detectLanguage",
  "project_id": "your-gcp-project-id",
  "content": "Bonjour, comment puis-je vous aider aujourd'hui?"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Confidence Score">
For short or ambiguous text, the detection may have a low confidence. The full `Response` object contains a `confidence` score that you can use to build more robust logic.
</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
* **Manage Costs:** The Translation API is powerful but not free. Monitor your usage in the Google Cloud Console. For internal tasks, consider if you can pre-process or batch texts to reduce the number of calls.
* **Use Correct Language Codes:** All language codes should be in ISO-639-1 format (e.g., `en`, `es`, `zh-CN`). An incorrect code will result in an error.
* **Error Handling:** Build logic in your agent to handle cases where language detection is not confident or a translation fails. The raw `Response` object is key for debugging.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Authentication Errors (`invalid_client`, `redirect_uri_mismatch`):**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `Client ID`/`Secret` or a misconfigured redirect URI.
    * **Solution:** Verify your credentials. Ensure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console is exactly `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`.

* **Permission Denied (`403 Forbidden`):**
    * **Cause:** The authenticated user does not have permission to use the Translation API on the specified `project_id`, or the **Cloud Translation API** is not enabled.
    * **Solution:** Ensure the API is enabled in your GCP project. Confirm the authenticating user has a role with permission to use the translation service, such as "Cloud Translation API User."

* **Invalid Argument (`400 Bad Request`):**
    * **Cause:** An invalid language code was provided, or the `project_id` format is incorrect.
    * **Solution:** Check that all language codes are valid ISO-639-1 codes. Ensure your `project_id` is correct.
