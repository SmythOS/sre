  <summary>Why Integrate ClickUp with Your Agent?</summary>

ClickUp is a powerful "do-it-all" productivity platform. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to connect your project management hub to any other tool or workflow.

- **Automated Task Creation:** Build agents that listen for triggers—a new customer in your CRM, a new bug report in your helpdesk, a new form submission—and automatically create corresponding tasks in the right ClickUp list, assigned to the right person.
- **Dynamic Project Management:** Keep ClickUp in sync with the real world. An agent can monitor a GitHub repository and, when an issue is closed, find and update the corresponding task's status in ClickUp.
- **Streamlined Workflows:** Use ClickUp as the source of truth for your agents. An agent can fetch its to-do list for the day from a specific ClickUp list, perform each task, and then update the task status as it completes its work.
- **Automated Reporting:** Schedule agents to run daily or weekly, fetch all tasks for a specific project using `Get Tasks`, and generate a custom progress report to be sent to stakeholders via email or Slack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **ClickUp account**.
- Your personal ClickUp **API Token**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With ClickUp

The connection between SmythOS and ClickUp is configured using a secure, personal API Token.

### Step 1: Get Your ClickUp API Token
1.  Log in to your [ClickUp account](https://clickup.com).
2.  Click on your profile avatar in the bottom-left corner to open the User Menu.
3.  Select **Apps**.
4.  Your personal **API Token** is displayed at the top of this page. Click the **Generate** button if one doesn't exist, or click **Copy** to copy your existing token.

### Step 2: Store Your API Token in SmythOS Vault
Your API Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your ClickUp API Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `clickup_api_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a ClickUp Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any ClickUp component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `ClickUp API Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `clickup_api_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Token from the Vault to **each** ClickUp component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which ClickUp Component Should I Use?

| If you need to… | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Create a new to-do item** | A `list_id` and task name | [Add Task](#add-task) | The primary method for programmatically creating new tasks. |
| **Mark a task as "Done"** | A `task_id` | [Update Task Status](#update-task-status) | Specifically designed to change a task's status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Complete"). |
| **Get all details for one task** | A `task_id` | [Get A Task](#get-a-task) | Retrieves the full record for a single, known task. |
| **See all tasks in a project list** | A `list_id` | [Get Tasks](#get-tasks) | Fetches multiple tasks at once, perfect for reporting or processing in a loop. |
| **Assign a task to someone** | A `task_id` and `assignee_id` | [Add Assignee To Task](#add-assignee-to-task) | The correct way to assign a user to a task. |
| **Find the ID for a specific List** | A `folder_id` | [Get ClickUp Lists](#get-clickup-lists) | Necessary for finding the `list_id` required by many other components. |

This is often the first step in a workflow that needs to navigate the ClickUp hierarchy. An agent gets the list of all spaces to find the `space_id` for the "Engineering" space.
</TipCallout>

<Divider />

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Token:** Always store your ClickUp API token in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand the Hierarchy:** ClickUp's structure is key: **Workspace > Space > Folder > List > Task**. To create a task in the right place, you often need to find the `list_id` first. Use components like `Get Spaces`, `Get Folders`, and `Get Lists` to navigate the hierarchy programmatically.
* **Use Custom Fields:** For advanced workflows, you can create Custom Fields in ClickUp (e.g., "Ticket ID," "Customer Email"). While not directly supported by default inputs, you can often update these fields by constructing a custom JSON payload in the `Body` of the `Update Task` component.
* **Pagination:** When using `Get Tasks` or other list components, remember that the API returns paginated results. You may need to build a loop that increments the `page` input to fetch all tasks if a list contains more than the default limit.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Token is incorrect, has been revoked, or is missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Token in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Generate a new token in your ClickUp Apps settings if necessary and update your Vault secret.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect ID was provided (e.g., `list_id`, `task_id`, `folder_id`).
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Use the "Get" components (e.g., `Get Lists`) to verify that the resource you are trying to access exists and you have its correct ID.

* **Error: `OAUTH_025` or `OAUTH_046`**
  * **Cause:** This often relates to permissions. The user whose personal API token is being used may not have access to the specific Space, Folder, or List you are trying to interact with.
  * **Solution:** Ensure the user associated with the API token has been invited to and has the necessary permissions for the target resources within ClickUp.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful project management automations with the **SmythOS ClickUp Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Functions as a helpdesk. It takes incoming support emails, creates a new task in a "Support" list in ClickUp using `Add Task`, and then assigns it to a team member using `Add Assignee To Task`.
    * Manages client onboarding. When a new client is added to your CRM, an agent creates a new List for them in a "Clients" folder, and populates it with a standard set of onboarding tasks.
    * Syncs with your calendar. The agent reads your [Microsoft Calendar](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/microsoft-calendar-integration) and creates a ClickUp task for every meeting scheduled for the next day.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a task is updated to "In Review" in ClickUp, trigger an agent to send a notification to a [Microsoft Teams](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/microsoft-teams-integration) channel.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to summarize a long project brief, then create a new parent task in ClickUp with the summary as the description.
    * Connect to a form builder. When a user submits a bug report through a form, create a new, high-priority task in your "Bugs" list.
