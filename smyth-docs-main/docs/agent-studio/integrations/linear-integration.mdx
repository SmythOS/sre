  <summary>Why Integrate Linear with Your Agent?</summary>

Linear is a powerful issue tracker designed for high-performance software teams. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to bridge the gap between your development process and your other business operations.

- **Automated Issue Creation:** Create agents that listen for triggers from other systems—a new bug report in a helpdesk, a feature request from a user feedback tool, or a critical alert from a monitoring service—and automatically create a corresponding issue in the correct Linear team's backlog.
- **Streamlined Bug Reporting:** Build an internal tool where QA testers can fill out a simple form, and an agent takes that information and creates a well-structured bug report in Linear, complete with logs and screenshots.
- **Connect Product and Engineering:** When a product manager finalizes a feature spec in Notion or a Google Doc, an agent can automatically create the parent "Epic" or "Project" issue in Linear for the engineering team.
- **Data-Driven Project Management:** Use agents to fetch data about your teams and issues to create custom reports or dashboards, giving you insights into your development velocity and workflow bottlenecks.

## Getting Started With Linear

The connection between SmythOS and Linear is configured using a secure, personal API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Linear API Key
1.  Log in to your [Linear account](https://linear.app/).
2.  Navigate to **Settings** > **API**.
3.  Under **Personal API Keys**, give your new key a descriptive label (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and click **Create key**.
4.  **Copy the API Key immediately.** It will not be shown again for security reasons.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Linear API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `linear_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Linear Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Linear component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `linear_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Linear component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Linear Component Should I Use?

| If you need to… | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Create a new bug report or feature request** | A `teamId` and a `title` | [Create Linear Issue](#create-linear-issue) | The primary method for programmatically adding new items to your Linear boards. |
| **Find the ID for your "Engineering" or "Design" team** | Your workspace | [Get Team Information](#get-team-information) | This is an essential first step to get the `teamId` required to create issues. |

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each Linear component.

### <a name="create-linear-issue"></a>Create Linear Issue
Creates a new issue within a specified team in your Linear workspace.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-linear) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Yes | The title of the issue you want to create. |
| `description` | string | Yes | The main body content of the issue. Supports Markdown for formatting. |
| `teamId`| string | Yes | The unique ID of the team where the issue will be created. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `issueId` | string | The unique identifier of the newly created issue. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Linear API, containing the complete issue object. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
An agent monitors a customer support channel. When a message contains the keyword "bug," the agent takes the message content and uses this component to create a new issue in the "Engineering" team's backlog for investigation.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "linear.createLinearIssue",
  "title": "User cannot log in with SSO",
  "description": "A user reported the following error: 'Authentication failed. Please try again.'\\n\\n**User Email:** user@example.com\\n**Timestamp:** 2025-06-12T10:00:00Z",
  "teamId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-a1b2-c3d4e5f6g7h8"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Markdown Support">
The `description` field fully supports Markdown. Use `\n` for new lines and other Markdown syntax to create well-formatted issue descriptions.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="get-team-information"></a>Get Team Information
Retrieves a list of all teams within your Linear workspace.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-linear) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `trigger` | any | Yes | Any input value can be used to trigger the component's execution. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `teamId` | string | The unique ID of the first team found. For a full list, parse the `Response`. |
| `teamName` | string | The name of the first team found. |
| `Response`| object | The raw JSON response, containing a list of all team objects with their IDs and names. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
This is often the first step in a workflow. An agent calls this component to get a list of all teams, finds the `teamId` for the "Marketing" team, and then uses that ID to create a new issue in their backlog.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "linear.getTeamInformation",
  "trigger": "start"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Parsing the Response">
The default `teamId` and `teamName` outputs only show the first team in the list. To find a specific team, you will need to loop through the `data.teams.nodes` array inside the `Response` object.
</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Your Linear API Key grants access to your workspace. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault` and never expose it.
* **Use the GraphQL API for Advanced Queries:** While these components cover common actions, Linear's power lies in its GraphQL API. For complex queries (e.g., getting all issues with a specific label assigned to a specific user), you may need to use a generic GraphQL component in SmythOS.
* **Find Your Team ID:** The most common prerequisite for creating issues is the `teamId`. Use the `Get Team Information` component first to programmatically find the correct ID rather than hardcoding it.
* **Automate Your Triage:** Combine the `Create Linear Issue` component with other tools to build a powerful triage system. An agent can receive an alert, use an LLM to determine its priority and relevant team, find the `teamId`, and then create a well-formatted issue.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, has been revoked, or is missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Generate a new key in your Linear settings if necessary and update your Vault secret.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `teamId` provided is incorrect or does not exist.
  * **Solution:** Use the `Get Team Information` component to get a valid list of team IDs and ensure you are using the correct one.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / Validation Error**
  * **Cause:** A required field like `title` or `teamId` is missing from the request.
  * **Solution:** Check that all required inputs are provided and are not empty strings.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful development workflows with the **SmythOS Linear Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Connects to your customer support software (like Zendesk or Intercom). When a user reports a bug, the agent automatically creates a new, detailed issue in your engineering team's Linear backlog.
    * Monitors a [GitHub repository](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/github-integration). When a new pull request is opened that mentions a specific issue ID in its title (e.g., `[LIN-123]`), the agent finds that issue in Linear and posts a comment with a link to the PR.
    * Acts as a "bug reporter" in Slack. A team member can use a slash command to trigger an agent, which asks them for a title and description, and then creates the issue in Linear for them.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a new issue is created in Linear, trigger an agent to create a corresponding channel in [Microsoft Teams](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/microsoft-teams-integration) or [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration) for discussion.
    * Connect Linear to your CI/CD pipeline. When an issue is moved to "Done," an agent could trigger a deployment process.
    * Log the time spent on issues by syncing data between Linear and a time-tracking application.
