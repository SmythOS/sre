  <summary>Why Integrate Asana with Your Agent?</summary>

Asana is a central tool for coordinating team work. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to connect your project management directly to your other business processes and data sources.

- **Automated Task Creation:** Build agents that listen for triggers—a new email, a form submission, a customer support ticket—and automatically create corresponding tasks in the right Asana project, assigned to the right person.
- **Dynamic Project Scaffolding:** When a new client is onboarded or a new initiative begins, an agent can automatically create a new Asana project from a template, complete with standard sections and introductory tasks.
- **Real-Time Progress Syncing:** Keep Asana in sync with your other tools. An agent can monitor a GitHub repository and, when an issue is closed, find and mark the corresponding task in Asana as complete.
- **Automated Reporting:** Schedule agents to run daily or weekly, fetch all tasks for a specific project or user, and generate a progress report that can be sent to stakeholders via email or Slack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- An **Asana account**.
- **OAuth 2.0 credentials (`Client ID` and `Client Secret`)** from the Asana Developer Console.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Asana

The connection is handled via OAuth 2.0. This requires a one-time setup in the Asana Developer Console to get your credentials.

### Step 1: Get Your OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1.  **Go to the Developer Console:** Log in to your Asana account and navigate to the [Asana Developer Console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps).
2.  **Create a New App:** Click on **+ New App**.
3.  **Fill in Application Details:**
    * Give your application a **Name** (e.g., "SmythOS Workflow Agent").
    * **Redirect URL:** Enter the SmythOS callback URL: `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback`.
4.  **Copy Your Credentials:** Once created, you will be taken to the app's settings page. Here you will find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy both values immediately.

### Step 2: Store Your Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your Client ID and Secret are sensitive credentials. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create new secrets for your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, giving them memorable names like `asana_client_id` and `asana_client_secret`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure an Asana Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Asana component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields, select the secrets you saved in the Vault.
4.  Click **Authenticate**. You will be redirected to Asana to authorize the connection.
5.  Your connection is now ready to use across all Asana components.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">The OAuth authentication flow connects your Asana account to SmythOS. You only need to complete this process once.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always store your Asana `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use GIDs:** Asana uses "Globally Unique Identifiers" (GIDs) for everything. You will often need to use a `List` component (e.g., `List Workspace Users`) to find the correct GID for a resource (like a user or project) before you can use it in another component.
* **Understand the Data Model:** Asana's structure is hierarchical: Organizations contain Workspaces and Teams, which contain Projects, which contain Sections and Tasks. Understanding this structure is key to using the right GIDs in the right places.
* **Use the `Body` for Updates:** For `Update Task` and `Update Goal` components, you must construct the JSON payload in the `Body` setting. Refer to the official Asana API documentation for the correct schema.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized` / Authentication Errors**
  * **Cause:** Your `Client ID` or `Client Secret` is incorrect, or the OAuth token has expired or been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Verify your credentials in the SmythOS Vault. Try re-authenticating the integration in the component settings to get a new token.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The authenticated user does not have permission to perform the action on the specified resource (e.g., trying to create a task in a project they are not a member of).
  * **Solution:** Check the user's permissions directly in Asana. Ensure they are a member of the relevant workspace, team, and project.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect GID (`project_gid`, `task_gid`, etc.) was provided.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all GIDs for typos. Use a `List` component to verify that the resource you are trying to access exists and you have its correct GID.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request`**
  * **Cause:** The JSON `Body` for a create/update operation is malformed, missing required fields, or contains invalid values.
  * **Solution:** Carefully validate your JSON structure against the official Asana API documentation. For example, when creating a task, `workspace` and `name` are typically required.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful project management automations with the **SmythOS Asana Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Connects to your helpdesk software. When a new bug report is filed, it automatically creates a new task in your "Engineering Bugs" project in Asana and assigns it to the appropriate developer.
    * Manages client onboarding. When a new client signs up, the agent creates a new Asana project for them from a template, complete with all standard kickoff tasks.
    * Syncs with your calendar. The agent reads your [Microsoft Calendar](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/microsoft-calendar-integration) and creates Asana tasks for all upcoming meetings with a specific client.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a task is marked as "complete" in Asana, trigger an agent to send a notification to a [Microsoft Teams](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/microsoft-teams-integration) or [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration) channel.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to summarize a long email thread, and then create a new task in Asana with the summary in the notes.
    * When a new row is added to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration), create a corresponding task in an Asana project.
