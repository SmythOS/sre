## Getting Started With OpenRouter

The connection between SmythOS and OpenRouter is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your OpenRouter API Key
1.  Log in to your [OpenRouter account](https://openrouter.ai/).
2.  Navigate to the [Keys section](https://openrouter.ai/keys) of your account settings.
3.  Click **Create Key**, give it a name, and copy the generated key.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your OpenRouter API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `openrouter_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure the OpenRouter Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **OpenRouter Chat Completion** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `openrouter_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to each OpenRouter component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the OpenRouter component.

### <a name="chat-completion"></a>Chat Completion
Provides a unified interface to send prompts to hundreds of different Large Language Models (LLMs).

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-openrouter) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Yes | The text input or question to send to the language model. |
| `model` | string | Optional | The ID of the model you want to use (e.g., `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`). Defaults to `openrouter/auto`. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `message_content` | string | The text content of the AI's generated response. |
| `id` | string | The unique identifier for the completion request. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the OpenRouter API, including usage data. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
Create a versatile "research assistant" agent. The agent takes a topic as a `prompt`, uses the `google/gemini-pro` model to get a detailed explanation, and then uses a second call with the `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct` model to summarize that explanation into three bullet points.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "openrouter.chatCompletion",
  "prompt": "Explain the concept of zero-shot learning in 50 words or less.",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Model Costs Vary">
Different models have different pricing. Be sure to check the cost per token on the OpenRouter website before running large-scale workflows.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your OpenRouter API key.
* **Model Selection is Key:** The most important choice you'll make is the `model`. For simple, repetitive tasks, choose a fast, cheap model. For complex, creative, or multi-step reasoning, choose a state-of-the-art model.
* **Leverage `openrouter/auto`:** If you're unsure which model to use, the `auto` setting is a great starting point. OpenRouter will choose a suitable model for you.
* **Prompt Engineering:** The quality of your output depends heavily on the quality of your `prompt`. Be clear, specific, and provide context or examples for the best results.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API key is missing, invalid, or disabled.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your OpenRouter dashboard.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** You have insufficient credits in your OpenRouter account.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your OpenRouter account and add credits to your balance.

* **Error: `404 Not Found` (for a model)**
  * **Cause:** The `model` ID you provided is incorrect, misspelled, or not supported by OpenRouter.
  * **Solution:** Check the [OpenRouter Models page](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models) for the correct, full model ID string (e.g., `openai/gpt-4-turbo`).

* **Error: `429 Too Many Requests`**
  * **Cause:** You have exceeded the rate limit for a specific model or for your account in general.
  * **Solution:** Add a delay in your agent between frequent calls. Some models have stricter rate limits than others.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build incredibly flexible AI agents with the **SmythOS OpenRouter Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a "writer's assistant." It first generates a blog post outline using a fast model like Mistral, then takes the approved outline and writes the full article using a powerful model like Claude 3 Opus.
    * Analyzes customer feedback. It uses a cheap model to quickly classify feedback as positive or negative. For negative feedback, it uses a more powerful model to draft a thoughtful, empathetic response.
    * A/B tests different AI models for a specific task. Send the same prompt to two different models via OpenRouter and compare their outputs to see which performs better for your use case.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine OpenRouter with the [ScrapingBee Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/scrapingbee-integration) to scrape content from a website and then use any LLM to summarize or analyze it.
    * Generate text with an OpenRouter model and then give it a voice using the [Elevenlabs Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/elevenlabs-integration).
    * Use OpenRouter to process data before logging it to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) or sending it as an [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration).
