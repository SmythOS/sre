  <summary>Why Integrate Klaviyo with Your Agent?</summary>

Klaviyo is a powerful marketing automation platform. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to connect your customer data and marketing actions to all your other business processes.

- **Automate List Management:** Build agents that automatically subscribe new customers from your e-commerce platform, segment them into lists based on their purchase history, and manage their subscription status.
- **Trigger-Based Campaigns:** Create workflows that go beyond Klaviyo's built-in triggers. An agent can listen for an event in any connected system—a support ticket closure, a product review—and add a user to a specific, targeted campaign.
- **Data-Driven Segmentation:** Use agents to analyze data from multiple sources (e.g., your app's database, CRM, support desk). Based on this holistic view, your agent can add or remove profiles from Klaviyo lists, ensuring your segments are always accurate and up-to-date.
- **Automated Reporting:** Schedule agents to periodically fetch campaign or flow analytics using the query components, and then format that data into a custom report or send it to a data warehouse for deeper analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Klaviyo account**.
- A Klaviyo Private **API Key**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Klaviyo

The connection between SmythOS and Klaviyo is configured using a secure, private API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Klaviyo API Key
1.  Log in to your [Klaviyo account](https://www.klaviyo.com/login).
2.  Click on your account name in the bottom-left corner, then go to **Settings**.
3.  Navigate to the **API Keys** section.
4.  If you don't have a private key, click **Create Private API Key**.
5.  Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and grant it the necessary scopes. For full functionality, you may need to grant access to Campaigns, Lists, Profiles, etc.
6.  Copy the generated API Key.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Klaviyo API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `klaviyo_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Klaviyo Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Klaviyo component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Klaviyo API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `klaviyo_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Klaviyo component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Klaviyo API key in the SmythOS `Vault`. Grant it only the permissions necessary for your agent's tasks.
* **Understand the Data Hierarchy:** To manage your audience effectively, you'll often need to get a `list_id` from `Get Lists` or a `profile_id` from `Search Profile` before you can add a profile to a list.
* **Use Webhooks for Real-Time Events:** While these components are great for taking action, Klaviyo's webhooks are ideal for triggering your agents in real time based on user behavior (e.g., opening an email, making a purchase).
* **Leverage Custom Properties:** When adding or updating profiles, you can include a `properties` object to store custom data (e.g., `{"favorite_color": "blue"}`). This is essential for advanced segmentation.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, has been revoked, or does not have the required permissions (scopes) for the action you are trying to perform.
  * **Solution:** Verify the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct. In your Klaviyo settings, check that the key is active and has been granted the necessary scopes (e.g., `Profiles: Write`, `Campaigns: Write`).

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect ID was provided (e.g., `list_id`, `profile_id`, `campaign_id`).
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Use the "Get" or "List" components to verify that the resource you are trying to access exists.

* **Profile Not Subscribing**
  * **Cause:** The list may be set to double opt-in, which means the user must confirm their subscription via email before they become active.
  * **Solution:** This is expected behavior for double opt-in lists. The API call succeeds by sending the confirmation email. Check your list settings in Klaviyo.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful marketing automation workflows with the **SmythOS Klaviyo Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Manages customer segmentation. It connects to your e-commerce store, and when a customer makes their 5th purchase, the agent adds their profile to a "VIP Customers" list in Klaviyo.
    * Automates re-engagement campaigns. An agent queries your database for users who haven't logged in for 90 days, adds them to a "Re-engagement" list, and then uses `Create Campaign Send Job` to trigger a special offer campaign.
    * Creates a dynamic "Product of the Day" email. Every day, the agent selects a product, gets its details and image, creates a new template with that content using `Create Template`, and sends it to your newsletter list.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a new user signs up in [Firebase](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firebase-integration), trigger an agent to add them to your "Welcome Series" list in Klaviyo.
    * Use data from [Stripe](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/stripe-integration) to segment customers. When a customer's subscription value exceeds a certain threshold, add them to a high-value customer list.
    * After a positive customer interaction is logged in your helpdesk, add that customer to a list to receive a "Request a Review" email campaign.
