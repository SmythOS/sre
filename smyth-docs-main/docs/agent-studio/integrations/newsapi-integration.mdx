  <summary>Why Integrate NewsAPI with Your Agent?</summary>

NewsAPI provides direct access to a massive, real-time firehose of global news. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful, information-aware agents that can:

- **Automate Media Monitoring:** Create agents that constantly scan for mentions of your brand, products, or executives and send alerts to Slack or email.
- **Enhance Market Research:** Programmatically gather news about competitors, industry trends, or new technologies to inform your business strategy.
- **Fuel Content Creation:** Automatically find recent, relevant articles to use as sources or inspiration for your own blog posts, social media updates, and reports.
- **Power AI Workflows:** Fetch a set of articles on a topic and feed them directly into an AI component for summarization, sentiment analysis, or trend extraction.

## Getting Started With NewsAPI

The connection between SmythOS and NewsAPI is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your NewsAPI API Key
1.  Log in to your [NewsAPI account](https://newsapi.org/login).
2.  Once logged in, your API key will be displayed on your dashboard.
3.  Copy the API key to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your NewsAPI API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `newsapi_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure the NewsAPI Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Search Everything** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `newsapi_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to each NewsAPI component you use. This ensures all connections are secure and properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the NewsAPI component.

### <a name="search-everything"></a>Search Everything
Searches through millions of news articles from a wide range of sources and blogs.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-newsapi) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `keyword` | string | Yes | The keyword or phrase to search for. |
| `from` | string | Optional | The earliest article date (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `to` | string | Optional | The latest article date (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `sortBy` | string | Optional | Order to sort articles by. Options: `relevancy`, `popularity`, `publishedAt`. Default: `publishedAt`. |
| `searchIn` | string | Optional | Comma-separated fields to search in. Options: `title`, `description`, `content`. Default: `title,description,content`. |
| `language` | string | Optional | Two-letter language code (e.g., `es`, `fr`). Default: `en`. |
| `page` | integer| Optional | Page number for pagination. Default: `1`. |
| `pageSize` | integer| Optional | Number of results per page (max 100). Default: `100`. |
| `domains` | string | Optional | Comma-separated string of domains to restrict the search to (e.g., `wsj.com,nytimes.com`). |
| `excludeDomains`| string | Optional | Comma-separated string of domains to exclude from the search. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `articles`| array | An array of objects, where each object represents a news article with its title, source, URL, etc. |
| `totalResults` | integer | The total number of articles found that match the query. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the NewsAPI. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
Create a brand monitoring agent. Every morning, it searches for your company's name, loops through the `articles` array, and sends the title and URL of each new mention to a dedicated Slack channel.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "newsapi.everything",
  "keyword": "\"SmythOS\" AND \"automation\"",
  "language": "en",
  "sortBy": "publishedAt",
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Developer Plan Limitation">
On the free Developer plan, the API can only fetch articles up to one month old. You also cannot sort by `popularity`.
</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your NewsAPI key.
* **Use Advanced Query Syntax:** The `keyword` input supports advanced search operators like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `""` for exact phrases. For example, `"SmythOS" AND ("funding" OR "launch")`.
* **Filter by Domain:** To monitor specific sources, use the `domains` parameter. This is great for tracking news from top-tier publications or industry-specific blogs.
* **Manage Pagination:** The API returns a maximum of 100 articles per page. If `totalResults` is greater than `pageSize`, you will need to build a loop in your agent that increments the `page` input to fetch all results.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API key is missing, invalid, or disabled.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your NewsAPI dashboard. Ensure your account is active.

* **Error: `429 Too Many Requests`**
  * **Cause:** You have exceeded the number of requests allowed by your plan in a given timeframe.
  * **Solution:** Check your plan's rate limits. If you are making many requests in a short period, add a delay between component executions in your agent.

* **Error: `426 Upgrade Required`**
  * **Cause:** You are trying to use a feature that is not available on your current NewsAPI plan (e.g., fetching historical data beyond one month on the Developer plan).
  * **Solution:** Upgrade your NewsAPI subscription or adjust your query to fit within your plan's limitations.

* **Empty `articles` Array**
  * **Cause:** The query genuinely returned no results for the specified parameters.
  * **Solution:** Broaden your `keyword` or date range (`from`/`to`). Remove any restrictive `domains` filters. Test the same query directly in a browser to confirm.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build intelligent, news-aware workflows with the **SmythOS NewsAPI Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Fetches the top 5 articles for a specific topic, feeds their content to an AI component for summarization, and generates a daily news brief.
    * Monitors news for specific company names and performs sentiment analysis on the article titles and descriptions.
    * Tracks mentions of a new product and logs the source, title, and URL of each article into a Google Sheet for the PR team.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine NewsAPI with the [Google Sheets Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) to create a historical log of media mentions.
    * Use search results to trigger alerts in [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration) or via [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration).
    * Feed article URLs found via NewsAPI into a web scraping component to extract the full text for deeper analysis.
