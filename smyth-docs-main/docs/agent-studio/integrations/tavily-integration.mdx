  <summary>Why Integrate Tavily with Your Agent?</summary>

Tavily is a search API built from the ground up for AI applications, particularly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It doesn't just return links; it provides clean, relevant, and comprehensive information.

- **AI-Optimized Results:** Tavily processes and filters search results to provide concise, relevant information, which is perfect for feeding directly into Large Language Models without extra noise.
- **Enhanced Data Access:** Go beyond a simple Google search. Tavily aggregates data from over 20 sources, giving your agents a broader and more comprehensive view of any topic.
- **Efficient RAG Workflows:** Tavily is ideal for RAG. An agent can perform a search to retrieve factual, up-to-date context, and then use that context to generate a more accurate and informed response with an LLM.
- **Automated Research:** Create agents that can perform deep research on any topic. They can use the search components to find relevant sources and the `Extract` component to get the full content for analysis.

## Getting Started With Tavily

The connection between SmythOS and Tavily is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your Tavily API Key
1.  Log in to your [Tavily account](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in).
2.  Navigate to the **API Key** section of your dashboard.
3.  Copy your API key.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Tavily API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `tavily_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a Tavily Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Tavily component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Tavily API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `tavily_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Tavily component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Tavily API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Combine Search and Extract:** For the most powerful research workflows, chain the components. Use a **Search** component to discover relevant sources, then pass the output URLs to the **Extract** component to get the full content for deeper analysis.
* **Use Domain Filters:** The `include_domains` and `exclude_domains` parameters are powerful tools for refining your search. Use them to focus on authoritative sources or to filter out known low-quality sites.
* **Leverage for RAG:** Tavily is purpose-built for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Use the clean content from its search or extract results as the context (`Retrieval`) for your LLM prompts to get more accurate and factual `Generated` answers.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, invalid, or missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your Tavily dashboard.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required` or Quota Errors**
  * **Cause:** You have exhausted the API credits available in your Tavily plan.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your Tavily account to check your usage and upgrade your plan if necessary.

* **Empty `Results` Array**
  * **Cause:** The search query genuinely returned no results, or the filters (e.g., `include_domains`, `time_range`) were too restrictive.
  * **Solution:** Broaden your query or remove filters to test the connection. Try a very common search term to ensure the component is working correctly.

* **URL in `failed_results` for Extract Component**
  * **Cause:** The website may have strong anti-scraping measures that even Tavily could not bypass, or the URL might be invalid or lead to a page with no main content.
  * **Solution:** This is expected for some sites. Build logic in your agent to handle failed extractions gracefully, such as by logging the failed URL or trying an alternative source.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful research and data extraction agents with the **SmythOS Tavily Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a "Daily Briefing" generator. It uses the **Advanced News Search** to find the top 5 articles about your industry from the last 24 hours, uses **Extract** to get their content, and then uses an LLM to write a summary of each for a morning email.
    * Performs automated competitor analysis. It takes a list of competitor domains, uses **Basic General Search** with `include_domains` to find recent mentions, and logs the results to a Google Sheet.
    * Powers a fact-checking chatbot. When a user asks a question, the agent uses Tavily to find several high-quality sources, extracts their content, and uses an LLM to synthesize an answer with citations.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Tavily with the [OpenRouter](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) or [Perplexity AI](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/perplexity-ai-integration) integrations to create state-of-the-art RAG pipelines.
    * Send the results of your Tavily searches directly to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for logging and analysis.
    * Use the `#extract` component to get clean article text and then pass it to the [PlayHT](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/playht-integration) or [Elevenlabs](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/elevenlabs-integration) integrations to create an audio version.
