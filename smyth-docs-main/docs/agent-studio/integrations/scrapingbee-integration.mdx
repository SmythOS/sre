  <summary>Why Integrate ScrapingBee with Your Agent?</summary>

ScrapingBee is a robust web scraping API that handles the complexities of modern web environments. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that can reliably extract data from virtually any source.

- **Automate Data Collection:** Create agents that automatically extract product prices, stock levels, or real estate listings from e-commerce sites and marketplaces.
- **Power Market Research:** Programmatically gather data from competitor websites, news outlets, or forums to analyze market trends and sentiment.
- **Enrich Your Datasets:** Use agents to visit a list of URLs and scrape specific information (like contact details or social media links) to enhance your existing contact lists or databases.
- **Bypass Blocks:** Leverage ScrapingBee's large proxy pool and advanced anti-bot detection systems to ensure your agents can access the data they need without being blocked.

## Getting Started With ScrapingBee

The connection between SmythOS and ScrapingBee is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your ScrapingBee API Key
1.  Log in to your [ScrapingBee Dashboard](https://app.scrapingbee.com/dashboard).
2.  Your API Key is displayed on the main dashboard page.
3.  Copy the API key to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your ScrapingBee API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `scrapingbee_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a ScrapingBee Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any ScrapingBee component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `scrapingbee_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** ScrapingBee component you use. This ensures all connections are secure and properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your ScrapingBee API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Choose the Right Tool:** Use the specialized Google scraping components when you need structured data from a SERP. Use the general "Scrape Web Page" components for all other websites.
* **Enable JavaScript Rendering:** For modern websites (SPAs), you must enable JavaScript rendering in the "Advanced: Scrape Web Page" component settings to get the full page content.
* **Use Country Codes:** To get geographically relevant results, especially for Google Search and Maps, always specify a `country_code`.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API key is missing, invalid, or disabled.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your ScrapingBee dashboard.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** You have run out of API credits, or your subscription does not cover the feature you are trying to use (e.g., premium proxies).
  * **Solution:** Check your credit balance and subscription plan in your ScrapingBee dashboard.

* **Empty Response or Blocked Message**
  * **Cause:** The target website is successfully blocking the request.
  * **Solution:** For the "Advanced: Scrape Web Page" component, try enabling **Premium Proxies** or **Stealth Proxies** in the settings. For Google scrapes, this is handled automatically but can still occasionally fail.

* **Incomplete Data from a Dynamic Site**
  * **Cause:** JavaScript rendering was not enabled for a site that requires it.
  * **Solution:** Use the "Advanced: Scrape Web Page" component and ensure the **Render JS** setting is toggled to `true`.

## What's Next?

You're now ready to build powerful data extraction agents with the **SmythOS ScrapingBee Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Scrapes product information from a list of e-commerce URLs and logs the name, price, and availability to a Google Sheet for price comparison.
    * Performs a Google search for a topic, scrapes the top 5 organic results, and feeds the content into an AI component to generate a summary report.
    * Scrapes Google Maps for a list of businesses in a specific category and location to build a lead list for your sales team.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine ScrapingBee with the [Google Sheets Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) to store your scraped data in a structured format.
    * Use scraped data to fuel workflows with AI components for analysis, summarization, or classification.
    * Trigger [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration) or [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration) alerts based on changes detected in the data you scrape (e.g., a price drop).
