## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Minimal Scopes & Permissions:** During Microsoft Entra app registration, request only the minimum necessary API permissions (scopes) for Microsoft Graph that your agents require (e.g., `Calendars.Read` if only reading, `Calendars.ReadWrite` for modifications). Adhere to the principle of least privilege.
* **Secure Credential Management:** Store your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` securely using SmythOS Vault. Never embed them directly in agent scripts.
* **Understanding `userId`:** Use `me` for operations on the authenticated user's own calendar. When accessing other users' calendars (e.g., shared calendars or as an administrator), use their User Principal Name (UPN) or GUID, and ensure appropriate delegated (`Calendars.Read.Shared`, `Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared`) or application permissions have been granted and consented to.
* **Time Zone Handling:** Microsoft Graph API is particular about time zones for events. Always specify the `timeZone` property within the `start` and `end` objects for events. Use valid IANA time zone names (e.g., "Pacific Standard Time", "UTC", "FLE Standard Time"). When filtering events by date/time using OData (`$filter`), it's often best to use ISO 8601 UTC format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`).
* **OData Query Parameters for Listing Events:** Leverage OData system query options like `$filter`, `$select`, `$top`, `$skip`, and `$orderby` with the "List Events" component to efficiently retrieve only the data you need.
    * `$select`: Reduces payload size by only returning specified properties.
    * `$filter`: Crucial for fetching events within specific date ranges or matching other criteria.
    * `$top` & `$skip` (or `@odata.nextLink`): Essential for pagination.
* **Error Handling:** Check the `Response` object from components for errors. Microsoft Graph API provides detailed error codes and messages. Implement robust error handling and retry logic (with exponential backoff for throttling) in your agents.
* **Idempotency for Event Creation:** If an agent might retry creating an event, consider strategies to avoid duplicates. Microsoft Graph event creation is not idempotent by default. You might need to list existing events to check for similar ones before creating, or store IDs of created events. The `iCalUId` can be useful for identifying unique events across systems.
* **Pagination for "List Events":** If "List Events" might return many results, always check for an `@odata.nextLink` property in the `Response`. Use this URL to fetch subsequent pages of data until no `@odata.nextLink` is returned.
* **`changeKey` for Updates (Advanced):** For updating or deleting some Microsoft Graph resources (less common for basic calendar/event properties but good to be aware of), you might need to provide the latest `changeKey` of the item to ensure you're modifying the most recent version and to handle concurrency. The API usually handles this for common calendar/event updates.
* **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Be aware of Microsoft Graph API rate limits and throttling. If agents make too many requests in a short period, you might receive `429 Too Many Requests` or `503 Service Unavailable` errors. Check for a `Retry-After` header in the `Headers` output and pause requests accordingly.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Encountering an issue with your Microsoft Calendar integration? Here are solutions to some common problems:

* **Authentication Errors (e.g., `invalid_client`, `AADSTS...` errors, token acquisition failure):**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `Client ID` or `Client Secret`; misconfigured Redirect URI in Microsoft Entra (must be `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback`); app registration issues; user not consenting to required permissions; token expired or revoked.
    * **Solution:** Verify `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Tenant ID` (if applicable) in SmythOS settings against your Microsoft Entra app registration. Ensure the Redirect URI is exact. Confirm the user has granted consent to all required API permissions during the OAuth flow. Try re-authenticating the integration in SmythOS.
* **`403 Forbidden` / Permission Denied Errors (e.g., "Access is denied. Check credentials and try again.", "Caller does not have permission"):**
    * **Cause:** The authenticated user or the application itself lacks the necessary Microsoft Graph API permissions (scopes) for the requested operation (e.g., trying to write to a calendar with only `Calendars.Read`).
    * **Solution:** In Microsoft Entra, go to your app registration > API permissions. Ensure the required scopes (like `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `Calendars.Read`) are added and have been granted admin consent if necessary. If using delegated permissions, ensure the signed-in user has permissions on the specific calendar.
* **`404 Not Found` Errors (for Update/Delete Calendar, or specific Event operations):**
    * **Cause:** The provided `calendarId` or `eventId` is incorrect, does not exist, or the authenticated user lacks permission to access it.
    * **Solution:** Double-check the ID for typos. Confirm the calendar or event exists in the user's account and verify permissions.
* **`400 Bad Request` (often with `Body` for Create/Update operations):**
    * **Cause:** The JSON `Body` provided for creating/updating a calendar or event is malformed, missing required fields (like `subject`, `start`, `end` for events, or `name` for calendars), or contains invalid values/formats for properties.
    * **Solution:** Carefully validate the JSON structure of your `Body` against the Microsoft Graph API documentation for the Calendar or Event resource type. Ensure all required fields are present and data types/formats are correct (especially for date/time strings and time zones).
* **Date/Time and Time Zone Issues with Events:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrectly formatted `dateTime` strings (must be ISO 8601); missing or invalid `timeZone` property within `start` and `end` objects; confusion between UTC and local times.
    * **Solution:** Ensure `dateTime` is in a format like `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"`. Always provide a valid `timeZone` (e.g., `"Pacific Standard Time"`, `"UTC"`) within the `start` and `end` objects. For OData filters on dates, typically use UTC format (`Z` suffix).
* **Events Not Appearing in "List Events" as Expected:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `$filter` syntax; `start/dateTime` and `end/dateTime` in filter not matching event times due to time zone differences; pagination not handled (only first page shown); `$top` too small.
    * **Solution:** Test `$filter` queries using Microsoft Graph Explorer first. Ensure date/time values in filters are correctly formatted (usually UTC for comparisons). Implement pagination using `@odata.nextLink`. Increase `$top` if expecting more results per page.
* **Throttling / `429 Too Many Requests` or `503 Service Unavailable`:**
    * **Cause:** Making too many API requests to Microsoft Graph in a short period, exceeding service protection limits.
    * **Solution:** Reduce request frequency. Implement delays or exponential backoff strategies in agent logic. Check the `Retry-After` header in the `Headers` output and wait for the specified duration before retrying.

<InfoCallout>
For persistent issues, the `Response` object from the component is invaluable. It contains the raw JSON error message from the Microsoft Graph API, which usually provides specific error codes and messages to help diagnose the problem.

## What's Next?

With SmythOS now integrated with your Microsoft Calendar, your agents are empowered to automate and streamline your scheduling, event management, and time-based workflows.

Here are some ideas to inspire your next automation:

* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Monitors a project management tool for new task assignments with deadlines and automatically creates corresponding events in the assignee's Calendar using "Create Event".
    * Allows users to request meetings via a SmythOS chatbot. The agent could then check availability by listing events and schedule the meeting using "Create Event", inviting all required attendees.
    * Sends a daily or weekly agenda summary to users via Microsoft Teams or email, by fetching upcoming events ("List Events") from their Calendar.
    * When a new team member is onboarded (triggered by an HR system), automatically creates a "New Team Onboarding" calendar ("Create Calendar") and schedules introductory meetings ("Create Event") with key colleagues.
* **Enhance Your Workflows by Combining Data & Actions:**
    * Use the [Microsoft Teams Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/microsoft-teams-integration) to send customized meeting reminders with additional context into a team channel.
    * Trigger calendar events based on data received from SmythOS database connectors or other third-party API integrations (e.g., creating a calendar event when a new sales lead reaches a certain stage in a CRM).
    * Update a central dashboard in a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) or SharePoint with details of important meetings or calendar events managed by your agents for reporting or team visibility.
    * If an event is created for a customer meeting, an agent could also create a reminder task in [Asana](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/asana-integration) or [Trello](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/trello-integration).
