  <summary>Why Integrate GitHub with Your Agent?</summary>

Integrating GitHub with SmythOS allows your agents to become powerful assistants in your software development lifecycle:

- **Automated Code Commits:** Agents can commit configuration files, documentation updates, or even generated code directly to repositories based on external triggers or data processing.
- **Intelligent Issue Management:** An agent can monitor external systems (like a bug tracker or customer feedback tool) and automatically create corresponding GitHub issues, assign labels, or update their status.
- **Pull Request Automation:** Agents can be configured to create pull requests when new feature branches are ready, or to fetch details of open PRs for daily summaries or to check for merge conflicts.
- **Release Monitoring:** Agents can fetch information about the latest releases, allowing other systems to be updated or notifications to be sent when new software versions are published.
- **Repository Health Checks:** Schedule agents to perform routine checks, like counting open issues, fetching commit activity, or ensuring branch naming conventions are followed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **GitHub Account** with access to the repositories you plan to integrate with.
- A **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the appropriate scopes.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With GitHub

The connection is configured using a secure Personal Access Token (PAT).

### Step 1: Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token
1.  **Sign in to GitHub** and navigate to **Settings** > **Developer settings**.
2.  Go to **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
3.  Click **Generate new token (classic)**.
4.  Give your token a descriptive **Note** (e.g., "SmythOS Integration").
5.  Set an **Expiration** period.
6.  **Select scopes:** For broad functionality, check the main **`repo`** scope. This grants full control of private repositories, including code, issues, and pull requests.
7.  Click **Generate token**.

### Step 2: Copy and Store Your Token
- **Important:** GitHub will show your new PAT **only once**. Copy the token immediately.
- For security, store this token in the SmythOS **Vault**. Create a new secret named `github_pat` and paste your token as the value. [Learn more about the Vault here.](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)

    <WarningCallout title="Secure Your Personal Access Token!">
    Your GitHub PAT is like a password. Treat it with extreme care. Do not commit it to repositories or share it publicly.
    </WarningCallout>

### Step 3: Configure the GitHub Integration in SmythOS
1.  In your agent graph, drag and drop any GitHub component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings**.
3.  In the `Access Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `github_pat`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for all GitHub components in that agent.

<InfoCallout title="Token Scopes & Permissions" collapsible >
If your agents encounter permission errors, the most common reason is that the PAT lacks the required scopes. You may need to regenerate the token with broader permissions (like the full `repo` scope) and update the secret in your Vault.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Personal Access Token (PAT):** Treat your PAT like a password. Store it securely using SmythOS Vault. Grant it only the minimum necessary scopes for the actions your agents will perform.
* **Understand GitHub API Rate Limits:** Be aware of GitHub's API rate limits. Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` in the `Headers` output. Implement graceful handling (e.g., delays) in your agents if they make many requests.
* **Pagination:** For components that list multiple items (issues, PRs, commits), always check for pagination information in the `Link` header (found in the `Headers` output) or use `page` and `per_page` parameters correctly to fetch all results.
* **Base64 Encoding for File Content:** For "Commit File" and "Update File Content," ensure the `content` input is correctly Base64 encoded.
* **SHA for File Updates:** When using "Update File Content," providing the correct `sha` (blob SHA) of the file you intend to update is crucial to avoid conflicts.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **`401 Unauthorized` Errors:**
    * **Cause:** Invalid, revoked, or missing Personal Access Token; Token does not have the required scopes for the action.
    * **Solution:** Verify the PAT is correct and active. Ensure it has the necessary scopes (e.g., `repo`). Update the token in SmythOS Vault.
* **`404 Not Found` Errors:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `issue_number`, or other identifier.
    * **Solution:** Double-check all identifiers for typos. Verify the resource exists on GitHub.com.
* **`422 Unprocessable Entity`:**
    * **Cause:** Invalid request body, missing required fields, or a business rule violation (e.g., creating a branch that already exists).
    * **Solution:** Carefully review the inputs. For file updates, ensure the `sha` is correct. For PRs, ensure `head` and `base` branches are valid and distinct.

<InfoCallout>
For persistent issues, the `Response` object from the component is your most valuable tool. It contains the raw JSON error message from the GitHub API, which usually provides specific details about what went wrong.

## What's Next?

With SmythOS integrated with GitHub, you can automate your entire development lifecycle.

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Automatically creates a feature branch, a draft pull request, and a tracking issue when a new task is created in your project management tool.
    * Monitors open pull requests and, once approved by two team members, automatically merges the PR and deletes the source branch.
    * Fetches the latest release notes and posts them to a company-wide Slack channel.
* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Trigger GitHub actions from an incoming [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration).
    * Log repository activity, such as new issues or commits, to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for reporting.
    * When a new user signs up in [Firebase](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firebase-integration), automatically invite them to a specific GitHub repository.
