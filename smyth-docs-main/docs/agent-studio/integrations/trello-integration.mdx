  <summary>Why Integrate Trello with Your Agent?</summary>

Trello is a simple yet powerful tool for visual project management. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to connect your Kanban boards to your other business processes, creating a central hub for automated task management.

- **Automated Task Creation:** Build agents that listen for triggers—a new email, a form submission, a new customer in your CRM—and automatically create a corresponding card in the "To Do" list on your Trello board.
- **Dynamic Workflow Management:** Create agents that move cards between lists based on external events. When a GitHub pull request is merged, an agent can find the related Trello card and move it from "In Review" to "Done".
- **Real-Time Status Updates:** Use agents to post comments on Trello cards with updates from other systems. For example, an agent can post a comment with a link to a deployment log when a feature is pushed to production.
- **Bridge Communication Gaps:** When a new card is created in a "Bugs" list on Trello, an agent can automatically create a corresponding, linked issue in a tool like Jira for the engineering team.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Trello account**.
- A Trello **API Key** and **Access Token**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Trello

The connection between SmythOS and Trello is configured using an API Key and an Access Token, which you can get by generating a Trello Power-Up.

### Step 1: Get Your Trello API Key and Token
1.  **Get API Key:** Log in to your Trello account, then visit `https://trello.com/power-ups/admin`. Create a new Power-Up for your workspace. Give it a name, select your workspace, and an API key will be generated for you.
2.  **Generate Token:** From the same page, or by visiting `https://trello.com/app-key`, you will find your key. Below your key, there is a link to manually generate a Token. Click it, and on the next page, click "Allow" to authorize the token generation.
3.  **Copy Both Credentials:** Copy both the **API Key** and the generated **Token**.

### Step 2: Store Your Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key and Token are sensitive credentials. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create new secrets for your `API Key` and `Access Token`, giving them memorable names like `trello_api_key` and `trello_access_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Trello Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Trello component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` and `Access Token` fields, select the corresponding secrets you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key and Access Token from the Vault to **each** Trello component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Your Trello API Key and Access Token provide access to your boards. Always store them securely in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand the Trello Hierarchy:** The core structure is **Board -> List -> Card**. To create a card, you first need the `list_id`. To create a list, you first need the `board_id`. Use the "Get" components to find these IDs programmatically.
* **Use Webhooks for Real-Time Actions:** For the most responsive workflows, set up a Trello webhook. You can configure it to trigger your SmythOS agent whenever an action happens (e.g., a card is moved to the "Done" list), allowing your agent to react instantly.
* **Markdown in Comments and Descriptions:** Remember that Trello card descriptions and comments support Markdown for formatting. Your agent can generate formatted text for clearer communication.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized` / "invalid key" or "invalid token"**
  * **Cause:** Your API Key or Access Token is incorrect or has been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the credentials in your SmythOS Vault are correct. Go to `trello.com/app-key` to check your key and re-generate a token if necessary.

* **Error: `404 Not Found` / "board not found" or "card not found"**
  * **Cause:** The `board_id`, `list_id`, or `card_id` you provided is incorrect or does not exist.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Ensure the board, list, or card has not been deleted or archived.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request`**
  * **Cause:** A required input is missing (e.g., you tried to create a card without a `name`), or a parameter is invalid.
  * **Solution:** Check that all required inputs for the component are provided and are in the correct format.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful project management automations with the **SmythOS Trello Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Creates a full project setup. When a new project is initiated, the agent calls `Create a Board`, then calls `Create Board List` multiple times to build the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" lists, and finally calls `Create a Card` to add a set of standard starting tasks.
    * Acts as a GitHub-to-Trello bridge. When a new issue is created in a [GitHub repository](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/github-integration), the agent automatically creates a corresponding card on a "Development" Trello board.
    * Manages your content calendar. An agent reads a list of blog post ideas from a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) and creates a Trello card for each one in an "Ideas" list.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a card is moved to the "Done" list on Trello (detected via webhook), trigger an agent to send a completion notification to a [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration) or [Discord](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/discord-integration) channel.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to summarize a customer email, then create a Trello card with the summary as the description.
    * When a new client is added in [HubSpot](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/hubspot-integration), create a new Trello card to track their onboarding process.
