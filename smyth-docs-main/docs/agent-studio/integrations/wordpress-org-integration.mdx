  <summary>Why Integrate WordPress.org with Your Agent?</summary>

Your self-hosted WordPress.org site gives you full control. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to leverage that control with powerful automation.

- **Automated Content Pipelines:** Create agents that take content from any source—a Google Doc, a Notion page, an AI model, or another website—and automatically create and format draft posts in your WordPress dashboard.
- **Content Synchronization:** Build an agent that monitors an external data source, like a product information system, and uses the `Update Post` component to keep your product pages or announcements perfectly in sync.
- **Streamlined Publishing:** Connect your content creation and review process. An agent can create a draft, notify an editor in Slack, and once approved, another agent could potentially update its status to "publish".
- **Programmatic Content Management:** Go beyond the WordPress dashboard. Use agents to perform bulk updates, delete old posts based on specific criteria, or manage content across multiple sites from a single interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A self-hosted **WordPress.org** site that is publicly accessible.
- An **Administrator** user account on your WordPress site.
- An **Application Password** generated for that user.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With WordPress.org

The connection is handled via Basic Authentication, which requires a username and a special Application Password, combined and encoded in Base64 format.

### Step 1: Generate an Application Password in WordPress
1.  **Log in to your WordPress Dashboard** as an Administrator.
2.  Navigate to **Users** > **Profile**.
3.  Scroll down to the **Application Passwords** section.
4.  Enter a new, descriptive name for your application (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and click **Add New Application Password**.
5.  **Copy the generated password immediately.** It will not be shown again. This is your `app_password`.

### Step 2: Encode Your Credentials in Base64
1.  Combine your WordPress username and the Application Password into a single string with a colon in between: `your_wp_username:your_app_password`.
2.  Use a Base64 encoding tool (like the "Encode/Decode" component in SmythOS) to encode this string.
3.  Copy the resulting Base64 encoded string.

### Step 3: Store Your Encoded Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your encoded credentials are a sensitive secret. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your **Base64 encoded string** as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `wordpress_org_auth`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 4: Configure a WordPress.org Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any WordPress.org component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Base 64 encoded username and app password` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Base64 encoded secret from the Vault to each WordPress.org component that performs a write action (Create, Update, Delete).</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Your `username:app_password` string is a direct login. Always Base64 encode it and store the result in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use Application Passwords:** Never use your main user password for API access. Application Passwords are revocable and specific to an application, which is much more secure.
* **Manage Media First:** To create a post with an image, you must first ensure the image exists in your WordPress Media Library. This may require a separate agent step to upload the image via the REST API to get the `image_id`.
* **Update Status to Publish:** The `Create Draft Post` component saves the post with a `draft` status. To publish it, you must use the `Update Post` component, providing the `post_id` and setting the `status` to `publish` in the request body.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Base64 encoded credentials are incorrect, or the user does not have sufficient permissions (must be an administrator or editor). The Application Password may have been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Re-encode your `username:app_password` string and verify it. Ensure the user account has the appropriate role in WordPress. Generate a new Application Password if needed and update your Vault secret.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `domain_name` is incorrect, or the `post_id` does not exist.
  * **Solution:** Check your domain for typos. Verify that the post you are trying to update or delete exists in your WordPress dashboard.

* **Image Not Appearing in Post**
  * **Cause:** The `image_id` provided to the `Create Post With Image` component is incorrect or does not exist in the Media Library.
  * **Solution:** Confirm the image ID in your WordPress Media Library. Ensure the image was successfully uploaded before calling the component.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful content automations for your self-hosted WordPress site with the **SmythOS WordPress.org Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Connects to your [GitHub repository](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/github-integration). When you merge a new Markdown file into a specific folder, the agent automatically converts it to HTML and creates a new draft post on your WordPress site.
    * Generates a weekly newsletter. The agent uses `List Posts` to get the titles and links of all articles published in the last 7 days, formats them into an HTML email, and sends it using [Resend](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/resend-integration).
    * Acts as a content translation pipeline. It takes an existing English post, sends the content to the [Google Translate Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-translate-integration), and then creates a new draft of the post in Spanish.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to expand a short idea into a full blog post, then use `Create Draft Post` to save it for review.
    * After an agent creates a new post, it can take the post's title and use the [Ayrshare Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration) to announce it on your social media channels.
