  <summary>Why Integrate Notion with Your Agent?</summary>

Notion is a uniquely flexible workspace. By connecting it to SmythOS, you transform it from a passive documentation tool into an active, automated hub for your operations.

- **Automate Content Creation:** Agents can generate new pages for meeting notes, project briefs, or reports, pre-filled with relevant data from other systems.
- **Dynamic Database Management:** Keep your Notion databases in sync with other tools. Log sales leads, track project tasks, or update inventory automatically.
- **Streamline Workflows:** Use Notion as a trigger or a destination. An agent can watch for a new entry in a database and kick off a workflow, or it can conclude a process by summarizing the results on a Notion page.
- **Centralize Information:** Agents can gather information from emails, Slack, and other apps, then organize and store it in a structured way within your Notion workspace.

Essentially, this integration allows your SmythOS agents to use Notion as their own memory and collaboration space, reducing manual data entry and keeping your entire team updated automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the integration, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. (If you're new to SmythOS, [you can sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup).)
- A **Notion Account** with permission to create integrations.
- The Notion pages or databases you want to automate must be **shared with your integration**.

## Getting Started With Notion

The connection between SmythOS and Notion is configured using a secure token.

### Step 1: Create a Notion Integration & Get Your Secret

1.  In your Notion workspace, go to **Settings & Members** > **Integrations**.
2.  Click **Develop your own integrations**.
3.  Click **+ New integration**. Give it a name (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and associate it with your workspace.
4.  On the next screen, you will see your **Internal Integration Secret**. Click **Show** and then **Copy** this token. This is the key you'll use in SmythOS.

    <Image src="https://developers.notion.com/images/getting-started/integration-secret.png" alt="Finding the Notion Integration Secret" />

### Step 2: Store Your Secret in SmythOS Vault

Treat your Integration Secret like a password. SmythOS provides a secure `Vault` for this.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Notion Integration Secret as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `notion_secret`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Share Your Pages/Databases with the Integration

For SmythOS to access a page or database, you must share it with the integration you created.

1.  Navigate to the Notion page or database you want your agent to access.
2.  Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner.
3.  Click the input field and find your integration by the name you gave it (e.g., "SmythOS Agent").
4.  Click **Invite**. The integration now has permission to edit (or view) that page and any child pages within it.

    <Image src="https://developers.notion.com/images/getting-started/share-a-database-with-your-integration.png" alt="Sharing a Notion page with an integration" />

### Step 4: Configure a Notion Component

1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Notion component.
2.  Click the component to open its settings.
3.  In the `Integration Secret` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `notion_secret`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component!

<WarningCallout title="Important">You must add the Integration Secret from the Vault to **each** Notion component you use in your agent. This ensures maximum security and control.</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Integration Secret:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your Notion Integration Secret. Never hardcode it directly in your components.
* **Manage Permissions Carefully:** In Notion, only share the specific pages and databases that your agent needs to access. This follows the principle of least privilege and enhances security.
* **Use Dynamic IDs:** Instead of hardcoding `page_id` or `database_id`, use outputs from previous steps. For example, use the `pageId` from a "Create Page" component as the input for a "Create Comment" component.
* **Master Database Queries:** The "Query Database" component is extremely powerful. Invest time in learning the [Notion filter syntax](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query-filter) to build highly specific and efficient automations.
* **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Check component outputs for errors. The `response` object often contains detailed error messages from the Notion API that are crucial for debugging.
* **Understand the Notion Data Model:** Familiarize yourself with how Notion structures data (pages, blocks, databases, properties). This knowledge will help you construct the correct JSON `body` for components like "Create Database" and "Query Database".

## What's Next?

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the **SmythOS Notion integration**. You're now ready to build intelligent agents that can manage your workspace, automate content, and streamline your workflows.

Consider these next steps:

* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Monitors a Slack channel for requests and creates corresponding tasks in a Notion database.
    * Receives an email with an attachment, summarizes its content using an AI component, and creates a new page in Notion with the summary and a link to the attachment.
    * Reads a list of new blog post ideas from a Google Sheet, then creates a draft page for each one in your Notion content calendar.
* **Explore Other Integrations:** Combine the power of Notion with other SmythOS connectors like [Google Calendar](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-calendar-integration), [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration), or [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration) to create end-to-end automation solutions.
