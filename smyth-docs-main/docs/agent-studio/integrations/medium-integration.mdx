  <summary>Why Integrate Medium with Your Agent?</summary>

Medium is a major platform for sharing ideas and stories. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to programmatically manage your content publishing and streamline your writing workflow.

- **Automate Content Syndication:** Create an agent that monitors your primary blog's RSS feed. When a new post is published, the agent can automatically re-publish it to your Medium account to reach a different audience.
- **Streamline Your Writing Workflow:** Build an agent that takes a completed article from a Google Doc, Notion page, or a Markdown file in a GitHub repository and publishes it directly to Medium, complete with tags.
- **Content Generation Pipelines:** Use an AI model to generate a draft article. An agent can then take this content, format it correctly, and publish it to Medium, turning ideas into live posts in seconds.
- **Connect Your Tools:** Bridge the gap between your content creation tools and your publishing platform. Let agents handle the tedious copy-paste work of moving content from one place to another.

## Getting Started With Medium

The connection between SmythOS and Medium is configured using a secure Integration Token.

### Step 1: Get Your Medium Integration Token
1.  Log in to your [Medium account](https://medium.com/).
2.  Navigate to your **Settings** by clicking your profile picture.
3.  In the "Security and apps" section, find the **Integration tokens** area. The direct link is `https://medium.com/me/settings/security`.
4.  Enter a description for your token (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and click **Get integration token**.
5.  Medium will generate a token for you. Copy it to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your Token in SmythOS Vault
Your Integration Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Medium Integration Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `medium_integration_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Medium Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Medium component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Integration Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `medium_integration_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Integration Token from the Vault to each Medium component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each Medium component.

### <a name="publish-blog"></a>Publish Blog Post
Publishes a new post to the authenticated user's profile or, if a `publicationId` is provided, to a specific publication.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `Integration Token` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-medium) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Component-Specific Settings
- **Content Format:** Select the format of your `content` input.
    - `html`: For content written with HTML tags.
    - `markdown`: For content written in Markdown.

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Yes | The title of the post. This is used for SEO but will not appear in the post body itself. |
| `content` | string | Yes | The body of the post. To have a title appear on the page, you must include it here (e.g., as an `<h1>` tag or `#` heading). |
| `userId` | string | Optional| The ID of the user to publish as. You must get this from the "Get User Details" component first. Defaults to the authenticated user. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `blogId` | string | The unique ID of the newly published post. |
| `blogUrl`| string | The direct URL to the live post on Medium. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Medium API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
An agent takes a Markdown file from a GitHub repository, reads its content, and uses this component to syndicate the article to Medium.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "medium.publishBlog",
  "title": "My New Post on AI Agents",
  "content": "# My New Post on AI Agents\\n\\nThis is the first paragraph of my amazing new article.",
  "userId": "1a2b3c4d5e6f"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Title Behavior">
Medium's API uses the `title` for metadata and SEO. It will **not** be displayed as a title in your post. You must include the title within the `content` field (e.g., `# My Title`) for it to be visible to readers.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="get-user-details"></a>Get User Details
Retrieves the profile information of the user authenticated by the Integration Token.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `Integration Token` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-medium) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `trigger` | any | Yes | Any input value can be used to trigger the component's execution. It does not affect the output. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `userId` | string | The unique identifier for the authenticated user. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Medium API, containing username, name, URL, and image URL. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
This component is primarily used as a first step to get your `userId`, which you can then pass into the `Publish Blog Post` component to explicitly set the author.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "medium.getUserDetails",
  "trigger": "get my id"
}
```

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Integration Token:** Always store your Medium Integration Token in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Content Formatting:** Decide whether you want to provide your content as HTML or Markdown and set the "Content Format" setting accordingly. For blog posts, Markdown is often easier to generate and manage.
* **Include the Title in the Body:** This is the most common point of confusion. Remember to add your article's title as a heading (e.g., `# My Title`) at the top of your `content` input if you want it to be visible on the published page.
* **Publishing to Publications:** To publish to a specific Medium Publication you own or contribute to, you first need to get that publication's ID. You can do this by using a custom API call to list the user's publications, then passing that ID into an advanced input field for the `Publish Blog Post` component.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Integration Token is incorrect, has been revoked, or is missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the token in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Generate a new token in your Medium settings if necessary and update your Vault secret.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request`**
  * **Cause:** A required field like `title` or `content` is missing from the request.
  * **Solution:** Check that all required inputs are provided and are not empty strings.

* **Article is Published Without a Title**
  * **Cause:** The title was provided in the `title` input but was not included in the `content` input.
  * **Solution:** Add the title as a Markdown heading (`# My Title`) or an HTML tag (`<h1>My Title</h1>`) at the beginning of the `content` string.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful content automation pipelines with the **SmythOS Medium Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Connects to your [Dev.to account](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/devto-integration). When you publish an article there, an agent is triggered to re-publish the same content to Medium.
    * Generates a weekly "Best of" digest. The agent finds your top-performing blog posts from the past, combines them into a new summary article, and publishes it to Medium.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * After an agent publishes a new article to Medium, it can take the `blogUrl` output and share it across your social media channels using the [Ayrshare Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration).
    * Keep a log of all published articles by having your agent write the `blogId` and `blogUrl` to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) or [Notion](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/notion-integration) database.
