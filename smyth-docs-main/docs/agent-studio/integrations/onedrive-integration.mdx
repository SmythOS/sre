  <summary>Why Integrate OneDrive with Your Agent?</summary>

Microsoft OneDrive is a cornerstone of modern document management. Integrating it with SmythOS unlocks powerful automation capabilities:

- **Automated File Organization:** Agents can automatically create folders, move files, and maintain a structured directory for projects, reports, or client records.
- **Seamless Collaboration:** Programmatically manage file sharing and permissions to ensure team members always have access to the latest documents.
- **Centralized Data Hub:** Use OneDrive as the single source of truth for documents generated or processed by your agents, from invoices to analytical reports.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Eliminate manual file handling by letting agents fetch, update, and manage your cloud storage, freeing up your team to focus on higher-value work.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Microsoft 365 Account** with administrative permissions to register applications in Microsoft Entra.
- Necessary permissions (e.g., `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `Group.Read.All`) granted to your application in Microsoft Entra.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With OneDrive

Authentication is handled via OAuth2, which requires you to register an application within the Microsoft Entra portal. This is a one-time setup.

### Step 1: Register an Application in Microsoft Entra
1.  Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2.  Go to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** and click **+ New registration**.
3.  **Configure your application:**
    * **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "SmythOS OneDrive Integration").
    * **Supported account types:** Choose the option that best fits your organization's needs.
    * **Redirect URI:** Select **Web** from the dropdown and enter `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback`.
4.  Click **Register**.

### Step 2: Obtain Client ID and Client Secret
1.  **Client ID:** From your new application's **Overview** page, copy the **Application (client) ID**. This is your `Client ID`.
2.  **Client Secret:**
    * In your application's menu, navigate to **Certificates & secrets**.
    * Under the **Client secrets** tab, click **+ New client secret**.
    * Add a description, choose an expiration period, and click **Add**.
    * **Immediately copy the `Value` of the new secret.** This is your `Client Secret` and it will be hidden after you leave this page.

### Step 3: Configure API Permissions
1.  In your app registration menu, go to **API permissions**.
2.  Click **+ Add a permission**, select **Microsoft Graph**, and choose **Delegated permissions**.
3.  Search for and add the necessary permissions for the components you intend to use. Common permissions include:
    * `Files.ReadWrite.All`
    * `Sites.Read.All`
    * `User.Read`
    * `Group.Read.All`
4.  Click **Add permissions**. If prompted, click the **Grant admin consent for [Your Directory]** button to finalize permissions.

### Step 4: Authenticate in SmythOS
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag any OneDrive component onto the canvas.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  Enter the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you obtained. For best security practices, store these credentials in the **SmythOS Vault** and reference them here.
4.  Click the blue **Authenticate** button. You will be redirected to a Microsoft sign-in page to authorize the connection.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">Once you authenticate, the connection is saved for your SmythOS account. You won't need to re-enter credentials for other OneDrive components. Use the **Sign Out** button in the component settings if you need to switch accounts or re-authenticate.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Use the SmythOS Vault:** Never hardcode your `Client ID` or `Client Secret` directly in your components. Always store them securely in the SmythOS Vault and reference them.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** In the Microsoft Entra portal, only grant the API permissions that your agent absolutely needs to function. Avoid overly broad permissions like `Files.ReadWrite.All` if your agent only needs to read files.
* **Manage IDs Dynamically:** Chain components together. Use the `driveId` or `itemId` from the output of one component as the input for another. This makes your workflows robust and adaptable.
* **Error Handling:** Always check the `response` output for error codes or messages. Build conditional logic in your agent to handle potential failures gracefully, such as by sending a notification or retrying the operation.
* **Group vs. User Components:** Be mindful of which components you are using. Operations on shared team libraries require the "Group" components and a `groupId`, while personal files use the standard user components and a `userId`.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `403 Forbidden` or `PERMISSION_DENIED`**
  * **Cause:** The application is missing the required API permissions in Microsoft Entra, or admin consent has not been granted.
  * **Solution:** Go to your app registration's **API permissions** page. Verify that you have added and granted admin consent for all necessary permissions (e.g., `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `Sites.Read.All`).

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `userId`, `groupId`, `driveId`, or `itemId` is incorrect. It could also be that the path in a `Get Item by Path` component is wrong.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs being passed into the component. Ensure they are correct and that the authenticated user has access. For path-based lookups, verify the full path is correct and URL-encoded.

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized` or Authentication Issues**
  * **Cause:** The `Client ID` or `Client Secret` is incorrect, or the OAuth token has expired.
  * **Solution:**
    1.  Verify that the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the component settings match the values in Microsoft Entra.
    2.  Use the **Sign Out** button in the component settings, then click **Authenticate** again to refresh the connection and obtain a new token.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful automations with the **SmythOS OneDrive Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Automatically saves email attachments to a specific "Attachments" folder in your personal OneDrive.
    * Watches a "New Invoices" folder in a team's shared drive and, upon detecting a new file, processes it and sends a notification to the finance channel in Slack.
    * Generates a monthly report, saves it as a PDF, and uploads it to a "Monthly Reports" folder in a SharePoint document library.

* **Explore Other Integrations:** Combine OneDrive with other SmythOS connectors. For example, use the [Google Sheets Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) to read data for a report, then use OneDrive components to save the final document.
