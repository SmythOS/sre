  <summary>Why Integrate PDF Monkey with Your Agent?</summary>

PDF Monkey is a powerful API for creating pixel-perfect PDF documents from templates and data. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build sophisticated document generation workflows.

- **Automate Invoicing and Billing:** Create agents that automatically generate and send PDF invoices to customers when a payment is due or an order is completed.
- **Generate Custom Reports:** Build workflows that gather data from multiple sources (like databases or other APIs), format it, and then use PDF Monkey to render a professional, branded PDF report.
- **Contract and Agreement Automation:** When a new client is onboarded, an agent can automatically populate a contract template with their details and prepare it for a signature workflow.
- **Personalized Document Creation:** Generate personalized certificates, tickets, or welcome letters at scale by feeding user-specific data into your PDF Monkey templates.

## Getting Started With PDF Monkey

The connection between SmythOS and PDF Monkey is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your PDF Monkey API Key
1.  Log in to your [PDF Monkey Dashboard](https://dashboard.pdfmonkey.io/).
2.  Navigate to your **Account** settings.
3.  In the API Keys section, you will find your **Private key**. This is your API Key.
4.  Copy the key to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your PDF Monkey API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `pdfmonkey_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a PDF Monkey Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any PDF Monkey component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `pdfmonkey_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** PDF Monkey component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your PDF Monkey API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Design Your Templates First:** The core of PDF Monkey is its powerful template editor. Build your HTML and CSS templates in the PDF Monkey dashboard first. Use their dynamic data syntax (e.g., `{{customer_name}}`) for all the data points you intend to populate via your agent.
* **Master the `Body` Payload:** The `Body` setting in the `Generate PDF` and `Generate Draft` components is where you pass your data. The JSON must have a `_payload` key, and its value should be an object containing key-value pairs that match the variables in your template.
* **Handle Asynchronous Generation:** PDF generation is not always instantaneous. For complex documents, it's best to check the document status using `Get Document Info` before trying to use the `download_url`.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, has been revoked, or is missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your PDF Monkey dashboard.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `document_template_id` or `document_id` provided is incorrect.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your PDF Monkey dashboard and double-check the ID of the template or document you are trying to access.

* **Error: `422 Unprocessable Entity`**
  * **Cause:** The JSON payload in the `Body` is malformed, or it is missing data for a required variable in your template.
  * **Solution:** Validate your JSON syntax. Ensure that the `_payload` object contains all the necessary keys that your template expects.

* **PDF Looks Incorrect or Data is Missing**
  * **Cause:** The keys in your JSON `_payload` do not exactly match the variable names in your PDF Monkey template (e.g., `{{customer_name}}` in the template vs. `"customerName"` in the JSON).
  * **Solution:** Carefully check that every key in your JSON payload is an exact match for the corresponding variable in your template.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful document generation workflows with the **SmythOS PDF Monkey Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Generates monthly invoices. The agent fetches billing data from [Stripe](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/stripe-integration), populates an invoice template using `Generate PDF`, and then emails it to the customer using [SendGrid](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/sendgrid-integration).
    * Creates personalized certificates. It reads a list of names from a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) and generates a unique PDF certificate of completion for each person.
    * Automates legal documents. When a new client is onboarded in your CRM, an agent takes their details, generates an NDA from a template, and sends it for signature using the [SignNow Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/signnow-integration).

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine PDF Monkey with a [database integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firestore-integration) to generate reports based on live application data.
    * Use a [web scraper](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/scrapingbee-integration) to gather data, format it into an HTML report, and then use the `HTML to PDF` component from [PdfCrowd](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/pdfcrowd-integration) or a similar tool to create a final document if you don't have a template.
