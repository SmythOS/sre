## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
* **Understand GA4 Quotas:** Be mindful of the Google Analytics Data API quotas to avoid service interruptions. Use `Batch Run Reports` to consolidate requests where possible.
* **Use Specific Dimensions & Metrics:** To optimize performance and cost, only request the dimensions and metrics you need for your analysis.
* **Implement Pagination:** For reports that may return a large number of rows, use the `offset` and `limit` parameters in the request `Body` to paginate through the results.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Authentication Errors (`invalid_client`, `redirect_uri_mismatch`):**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `Client ID`/`Secret` or a misconfigured redirect URI.
    * **Solution:** Verify your credentials. Ensure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console is exactly `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`.

* **Permission Denied (`403 Forbidden`):**
    * **Cause:** The authenticated user lacks "Viewer" permissions for the GA4 property, or the required API scopes were not granted.
    * **Solution:** Confirm the user has adequate permissions in the GA4 Admin panel. Ensure the `analytics.readonly` scope was added and consented to during authentication.

* **Invalid Argument (`400 Bad Request`):**
    * **Cause:** The `GA4_property_id` is formatted incorrectly, or a dimension/metric name is invalid or misspelled.
    * **Solution:** Ensure the property ID is `properties/YOUR_ID`. Check all dimension and metric names against the official GA4 Data API documentation.

* **No Data Returned (`rowCount` is 0):**
    * **Cause:** The GA4 property genuinely has no data for the requested query, or filters are too restrictive.
    * **Solution:** Verify that data exists for the same query in the GA4 Explore reports. Try a broader date range or simpler dimensions to test the connection.
