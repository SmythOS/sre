  <summary>Why Integrate Resend with Your Agent?</summary>

Resend is a modern email platform designed for developers. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build reliable and powerful communication workflows.

- **Automate Transactional Emails:** Create agents that automatically send critical emails like account verifications, password resets, order confirmations, and invoices, ensuring reliable delivery.
- **Reliable Alerting System:** When an agent detects an important event—a system failure, a new high-value customer—it can use Resend to send a dependable email alert to the right people.
- **Streamline User Onboarding:** Build an agent that, upon a new user sign-up, sends a beautifully formatted welcome email, starting the customer relationship on the right foot.
- **Centralize Email Logic:** Manage all your application's transactional email logic from within SmythOS agents, making it easy to update, monitor, and control your email communications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

## Getting Started With Resend

The connection between SmythOS and Resend is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key
1.  Log in to your [Resend account](https://resend.com/).
2.  Navigate to the **API Keys** section in the left-hand menu.
3.  Click the **+ Create API Key** button.
4.  Give your key a name (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and set the permission to **Full access**.
5.  Click **Add**.
6.  **Copy the API key immediately.** It will not be shown again for security reasons.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Resend API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `resend_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure the Resend Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Send Email** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Authentication Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `resend_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to each Resend component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the Resend component.

### <a name="send-email"></a>Send Email
Sends an email with a specified subject and content to one or more recipients. The content can be plain text or HTML.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-resend) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `From` | string | Yes | The sender's email address (e.g., `You <you@example.com>`). Must use a domain verified in Resend. |
| `To` | string/array| Yes | The recipient's email address. Can be a single string or an array of strings for multiple recipients. |
| `Subject`| string | Yes | The subject line of the email. |
| `Text` | string | Yes | The plain text body content of the email. You can also pass HTML content here. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | The unique ID of the sent email, useful for tracking. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Resend API, containing the `id` and other details. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
An agent processes a password reset request. It generates a unique reset link, and then calls this component to send an email to the user with the subject "Your Password Reset Link" and the link in the `Text` body.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "resend.sendEmail",
  "From": "Onboarding Team <onboarding@example.com>",
  "To": "new.user@example.com",
  "Subject": "Welcome to SmythOS!",
  "Text": "<h1>Welcome aboard!</h1><p>We're so glad to have you. Let us know if you need anything.</p>"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Verified Domain Required">
To send emails in a production environment, you **must** verify your domain in Resend. Emails sent from unverified domains will fail.
</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Resend API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use HTML for Rich Emails:** The `Text` input can accept a full HTML string. Use this to send beautifully designed emails. For more complex designs, consider building the HTML outside the agent and passing it in as a variable.
* **Verify Your Domain:** The most critical step for deliverability is to complete the Domain Authentication process in your Resend account. This improves your sending reputation and ensures your emails don't land in spam.
* **Handle Bounces and Complaints:** Use the Resend dashboard to monitor your email activity. If you see high bounce or complaint rates, investigate the causes to protect your sender reputation.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect or has been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Generate a new key in Resend if necessary and update your Vault secret.

* **Error: `422 Unprocessable Entity` / "You must verify your domain to send emails"**
  * **Cause:** You are trying to send an email from a domain that has not been verified in your Resend account.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your Resend account, go to the **Domains** section, and follow the instructions to add and verify your sending domain by adding DNS records.

* **Emails Go to Spam**
  * **Cause:** This is a complex deliverability issue often related to a new domain's reputation or the content of the email.
  * **Solution:** Ensure your domain is fully verified in Resend (with DKIM/SPF). Warm up your domain by sending a small volume of high-quality emails first. Avoid spammy words in your subject and content.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful email workflows with the **SmythOS Resend Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Manages a product waitlist. When a user signs up, the agent adds them to a database. When the product launches, the agent iterates through the list and sends a personalized launch announcement email to each user.
    * Sends a daily summary report. The agent gathers data from various sources ([Google Analytics](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-analytics-integration), internal databases), formats it into an HTML report, and emails it to stakeholders.
    * Powers an alert system. When a system monitoring tool detects an issue, it triggers an agent that sends a high-priority email alert to the on-call engineering team.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Resend with a database integration like [Firestore](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firestore-integration). When a new record is added, trigger an agent to send a confirmation email.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to draft a personalized follow-up email based on a customer's recent activity, then send it via Resend.
    * Connect to a payment processor. When a subscription payment fails, send a dunning email to the customer asking them to update their payment information.
