  <summary>Why Integrate Supabase with Your Agent?</summary>

Supabase provides the power of a PostgreSQL database with the convenience of a modern, developer-friendly interface. Integrating it with SmythOS allows your agents to have a robust, scalable, and persistent memory.

- **Automate Data Management:** Create agents that can automatically save, retrieve, and manage data in a structured SQL database. Log application events, store user preferences, or manage content for a CMS, all programmatically.
- **Build Application Backends:** Use SmythOS agents as a serverless backend for your applications. An agent can handle API requests, process data, and interact with your Supabase database, all in one workflow.
- **Create a "Memory" for Your Agents:** Allow agents to remember information and context across different sessions and executions by storing state in a Supabase table.
- **Data-Driven Workflows:** Trigger agents based on database changes (using Supabase Functions and webhooks) or have agents make complex decisions based on the relational data they retrieve from your database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Supabase account** with a project created.
- Your Supabase Project's **URL** and **`service_role` secret key**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Supabase

The connection between SmythOS and Supabase is configured using your Project URL and a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials
1.  Log in to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/).
2.  Select the project you want to connect to.
3.  In the left menu, navigate to **Project Settings** (the gear icon).
4.  Click on the **API** tab.
5.  On this page, you will find your Project **URL** and your project API keys.
6.  **Copy the Project URL.**
7.  Under "Project API keys," find the **`service_role`** secret key and click "reveal" to see the full key. **Copy this key.**

### Step 2: Store Your Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your `service_role` key grants full access to your database, bypassing any Row Level Security policies. It is a highly sensitive credential.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create new secrets for your Supabase URL and your `service_role` key. Give them memorable names, like `supabase_project_url` and `supabase_service_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Supabase Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Supabase component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` (for the Project URL) and `Role Secret` (for the service_role key) fields, select the corresponding secrets you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured. You will provide the `project_id` (the reference ID from your URL) as a standard input.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key and Role Secret from the Vault to **each** Supabase component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated with the correct permissions.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Service Key:** Your `service_role` key can bypass all database security policies. **Never** expose it publicly. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault`. For read-only operations, consider creating and using the `anon` key if your security rules allow it.
* **Use Row Level Security (RLS):** For any production application, enable Row Level Security on your Supabase tables. This provides a critical layer of security, even if your `service_role` key were to be compromised.
* **Master PostgREST Filtering:** The power of Supabase's API comes from its PostgREST filtering capabilities. Learn the operators (`eq`, `gt`, `lt`, `like`, `in`, etc.) to build precise queries directly in your component inputs for components like `Read Rows`, `Update Row`, and `Delete Row`.
* **Create Database Functions:** For complex, multi-step database operations (like "increment a value by 10"), create a PostgreSQL function inside your Supabase project. You can then call this single function from your agent, which is more efficient and secure than making multiple API calls.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key (`anon` or `service_role` key) is incorrect or missing from the request headers.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the keys in your SmythOS Vault are correct and match those in your Supabase project's API settings. Ensure they are correctly selected in the component settings.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `project_id` is incorrect, or the `table` name does not exist.
  * **Solution:** Double-check your project reference ID and the table name for typos. Ensure you are targeting the correct project.

* **Write Operation Fails (Insert/Update/Delete)**
  * **Cause:** This is often due to a database constraint violation. For example, trying to insert a row with a `user_email` that is marked as `UNIQUE` but already exists, or trying to insert a `null` value into a `NOT NULL` column.
  * **Solution:** Check the `Response` output for the detailed error message from PostgreSQL. This will usually tell you exactly which constraint was violated. Ensure the data in your `Body` matches your table's schema.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful, data-driven applications with the **SmythOS Supabase Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a complete serverless backend for a user registration system. It uses the [Firebase Auth Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firebase-integration) for authentication, and then `Insert Row` to save new user profiles to your Supabase `profiles` table.
    * Creates a logging service. After any critical action (like sending an email with [Resend](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/resend-integration) or processing a payment with [Stripe](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/stripe-integration)), an agent inserts a log record into a `logs` table in Supabase.
    * Powers a dynamic website. An agent uses `Read Rows` to fetch content (like blog posts or product listings) from your Supabase database and provides it to a frontend framework.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use Supabase as the source of truth for a marketing campaign. An agent can `Read Rows` to get a list of customer emails, then pass them to the [Mailchimp Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/mailchimp-integration) to add them to a new campaign.
    * When a new record is added to a Supabase table (detected via a webhook), trigger an agent to send a notification to a [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration) channel.
