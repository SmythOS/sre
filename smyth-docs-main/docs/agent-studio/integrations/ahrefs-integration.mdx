## Getting Started With Ahrefs

The connection between SmythOS and Ahrefs is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your Ahrefs API Key
1.  Log in to your [Ahrefs account](https://ahrefs.com/).
2.  In the top-right corner, click on your profile icon and go to **Account settings**.
3.  From the left-hand menu, navigate to the **API** section.
4.  If you don't have a key, click **Generate New API Key**.
5.  Copy your API key.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your Ahrefs API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Ahrefs API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `ahrefs_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure an Ahrefs Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Ahrefs component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `ahrefs_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Ahrefs component you use. This provides granular control and ensures all connections are secure.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Your Ahrefs API key is a credential. Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely. Never expose it in plaintext in your agent's configuration.
* **Be Specific with `select`:** To minimize your API credit usage and speed up your agent, only request the fields you absolutely need in the `select` parameter.
* **Handle Rate Limits:** The Ahrefs API has usage limits. Design your agents to handle potential rate-limiting errors, perhaps by inspecting the response headers or building in small delays between large batches of requests.
* **Paginate for Large Audits:** For comprehensive audits, you may need more than the maximum `limit` of 1000 results. The Ahrefs API supports cursor-based pagination; you can build a looping mechanism in your agent to fetch all pages of results.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API key provided is invalid, has been revoked, or is not included in the request.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API key stored in your SmythOS Vault is correct and has not expired. Ensure the key is correctly selected in the component's settings.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** Your Ahrefs subscription has expired, or you have exhausted your API credits for the month.
  * **Solution:** Check your subscription status and API usage in your Ahrefs account settings.

* **Empty `backlinks` or `refdomains` Array**
  * **Cause:** The target may genuinely have no data, or the `target` parameter is formatted incorrectly.
  * **Solution:** Double-check the `target`. For domains, do not include `http://` or `www.`. For prefixes, ensure it ends with a `*`. Confirm in the Ahrefs UI that the target has data.

## What's Next?

You're now ready to build powerful, automated SEO workflows with the **SmythOS Ahrefs Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Runs weekly, fetches all new backlinks using `List All Backlinks`, filters for links with a Domain Rating over 50, and logs them in a Google Sheet.
    * Monitors a competitor's domain with `List Referring Domains`, and when a new, high-quality domain is found, sends an alert to a Slack channel for your outreach team.
    * Performs a monthly health check by using `List Broken Backlinks`, generating a PDF report of the findings, and emailing it to the webmaster.

* **Explore Other Integrations:** Combine Ahrefs data with other SmythOS tools. Use the [Google Sheets Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for reporting, or the [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration) components to automate notifications.
