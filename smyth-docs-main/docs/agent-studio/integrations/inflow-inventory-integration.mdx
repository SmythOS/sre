  <summary>Why Integrate InFlow Inventory with Your Agent?</summary>

InFlow Inventory is a powerful system for managing the core of your physical business. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to connect your inventory operations to every other part of your business.

- **Automate Product Management:** Create agents that can automatically add new products to your InFlow inventory from a supplier's data feed, a spreadsheet, or your e-commerce platform.
- **Synchronize Customer Data:** Keep your customer records consistent. When a new client is created in your CRM or e-commerce store, an agent can automatically create a corresponding customer profile in InFlow.
- **Streamline Order-to-Cash:** Build a workflow where a new sales order in another system triggers an agent to check stock levels in InFlow, and if the stock is available, proceed with creating an invoice.
- **Data-Driven Reporting:** Schedule agents to periodically fetch product, customer, or category lists to create custom reports, analyze trends, or feed data into a business intelligence tool.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

## Getting Started With InFlow Inventory

The connection between SmythOS and InFlow Inventory is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your InFlow Inventory API Key
1.  Log in to your InFlow Inventory account.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** or **API** section within your account dashboard to find or generate your API key. This process may vary depending on your InFlow version (Cloud or On-premise).
3.  You will also need your **Company ID**, which is often found in your account or company profile settings.
4.  Copy the API Key to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your InFlow Inventory API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `inflow_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure an InFlow Inventory Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any InFlow Inventory component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `inflow_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component. You will provide the `companyId` as a standard input.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** InFlow component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your InFlow Inventory API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand the Data Hierarchy:** To manage inventory effectively, you need the correct IDs. A common workflow is to first use a `Get` or `List` component to find the `productId` or `customerId` before attempting to update a record.
* **Use for Synchronization:** This integration is ideal for creating a single source of truth for your inventory. Build agents that sync data between InFlow and your other platforms (e-commerce, accounting, CRM) to ensure consistency.
* **Error Handling:** When adding a product, check for errors related to duplicate SKUs. Your agent should be able to handle these cases gracefully, perhaps by switching to an "update" logic instead of "create".

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, has been disabled, or is missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your InFlow Inventory account settings.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect `companyId`, `productId`, or other identifier was provided.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Ensure the resource you are trying to access exists within your InFlow account.

* **No Results Found in Search**
  * **Cause:** The `search_details` query may not have any matches, or the term might be too specific.
  * **Solution:** Try a broader search term to confirm the connection is working. Check for typos in your query.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful inventory management automations with the **SmythOS InFlow Inventory Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a full product lifecycle manager. When a new product is added to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration), the agent creates it in InFlow, then creates a corresponding product page on a [Shopify](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/shopify-integration) or [Squarespace](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/squarespace-integration) store.
    * Manages stock levels. It connects to your e-commerce store's API. When a sale is made, it automatically decreases the stock quantity in InFlow. When new stock arrives, it increases the quantity.
    * Syncs customer data. When a new client is added in [Jobber](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/jobber-integration), an agent creates a corresponding customer record in InFlow Inventory.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Connect InFlow to your accounting software. When a new sales order is fulfilled in InFlow, trigger an agent to create an invoice in your accounting platform.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to generate a rich product description, then use the InFlow API to update the product record.
