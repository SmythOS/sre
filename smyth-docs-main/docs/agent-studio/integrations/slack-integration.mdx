  <summary>Why Integrate Slack with Your Agent?</summary>

Slack is the digital headquarters for countless teams. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that communicate and deliver information where your team is already working.

- **Automated Alerting:** Create agents that monitor your infrastructure, applications, or support queues. When a critical event occurs, the agent can instantly post a detailed alert to the appropriate `#alerts` or `#devops` channel.
- **Centralized Notifications:** Instead of relying on email, have your agents send all their notifications—from new sales leads to project status updates—into dedicated Slack channels. This keeps information organized and accessible.
- **Reporting and Summaries:** Schedule an agent to run daily or weekly, gather data from various sources like Google Analytics or your CRM, and post a concise summary report in a leadership channel.
- **Streamline Workflows:** Use Slack as the final step in a workflow. An agent can process data, generate a result, and deliver that result directly to a user or channel, closing the loop on an automated task.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Slack workspace** where you have permission to install apps.
- A Slack **Bot User OAuth Token**.

## Getting Started With Slack

The connection between SmythOS and Slack is configured using a secure Bot Token, which you get by creating a Slack App.

### Step 1: Create a Slack App and Get Your Token
1.  Navigate to the [Slack API dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **Create New App**.
2.  Choose **From scratch**.
3.  Give your app a name (e.g., "SmythOS Notifier") and select the workspace you want to install it in. Click **Create App**.
4.  You will be taken to the app's basic information page. In the left menu, click on **OAuth & Permissions**.
5.  Scroll down to the **Scopes** section. Under "Bot Token Scopes," click **Add an OAuth Scope**.
6.  Add the `chat:write` scope. This allows your app to post messages in channels it's a member of. You may need other scopes like `channels:read` or `users:read` for more advanced components.
7.  Scroll back to the top of the "OAuth & Permissions" page and click **Install to Workspace**.
8.  Follow the prompts to authorize the app.
9.  After authorization, the page will reload, and you will see a **Bot User OAuth Token** (it starts with `xoxb-`). **Copy this token immediately.**

### Step 2: Store Your Bot Token in SmythOS Vault
Your Bot Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Slack Bot User OAuth Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `slack_bot_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Slack Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Send Message** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Bot User OAuth Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `slack_bot_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured.

### Step 4: Add the Bot to a Channel
For your bot to post messages in a channel, it must be a member of that channel.
1.  In Slack, go to the channel where you want to post messages.
2.  Type `/invite @[Your Bot's Name]` and press Enter.
3.  Your bot is now ready to post in that channel.

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the Slack component.

### <a name="send-message"></a>Send Message
Posts a message to a specified public or private channel in your Slack workspace.

<InfoCallout>This component requires a `Bot User OAuth Token` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-slack) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `channel_id` | string | Yes | The ID of the channel, private group, or user to send the message to. |
| `text` | string | Yes | The text content of the message. Supports Slack's `mrkdwn`. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | A descriptor of the operation's success or failure (e.g., "ok"). |
| `msgObj` | object | The message object containing details of the sent message, including its timestamp (`ts`). |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Slack API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
A deployment agent monitors a GitHub workflow. When the deployment to production is successful, it uses this component to send a message to the `#engineering` channel: `✅ Production deployment of v2.5.1 was successful.`
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "slack.sendMessage",
  "channel_id": "C012AB3CD4E",
  "text": "Heads up team, a new high-priority support ticket has just been created."
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Finding the Channel ID">
To get a channel's ID, open Slack, right-click on the channel name in the sidebar, and select "Copy Link". The ID is the string of characters that starts with `C` (for public channels) or `G` (for private channels).

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Bot Token:** Your Bot User OAuth Token can post messages and perform actions as your bot. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use `mrkdwn` for Formatting:** The `text` input supports Slack's `mrkdwn` syntax. Use it to make your messages more readable with *bold*, _italic_, `code`, and > blockquotes.
* **Master Block Kit for Rich Messages:** For more advanced formatting than `mrkdwn`, you can construct a `blocks` array in a custom API call. Block Kit allows you to build messages with buttons, images, and complex layouts.
* **Use Dedicated Channels:** For automated notifications, it's a best practice to create dedicated channels (e.g., `#alerts`, `#deployments`, `#new-leads`) to keep conversations organized and prevent clutter in general channels.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `not_in_channel`**
  * **Cause:** The bot you are using to post the message has not been invited to the specified `channel_id`.
  * **Solution:** In the target Slack channel, type `/invite @[Your Bot's Name]` to add it to the channel.

* **Error: `invalid_auth`**
  * **Cause:** The Bot User OAuth Token is incorrect, invalid, or has been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the token in your SmythOS Vault is correct. If needed, generate a new one in your Slack App settings and update the Vault secret.

* **Error: `channel_not_found`**
  * **Cause:** The `channel_id` provided is incorrect or does not exist.
  * **Solution:** Double-check the channel ID by right-clicking the channel in Slack and selecting "Copy Link".

* **Error: `missing_scope`**
  * **Cause:** The Bot Token does not have the required permissions (scopes) to perform the action.
  * **Solution:** Go to your Slack App's settings in the Slack API dashboard, navigate to **OAuth & Permissions**, and add the necessary Bot Token Scopes (e.g., `chat:write`). You will need to reinstall the app to your workspace after changing scopes.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful notification and communication workflows with the **SmythOS Slack Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Creates a daily "digest" of all new tasks created in [Asana](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/asana-integration) or [Trello](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/trello-integration) and posts it in a project channel.
    * Monitors your company's Twitter mentions. When a negative tweet is detected (using a sentiment analysis model), it sends an urgent alert to the `#pr-crisis` channel with a link to the tweet.
    * Connects to your e-commerce store. When a new order over $500 is placed, it posts a celebratory message with a GIF in the `#sales-wins` channel.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Slack with a database integration like [Firestore](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firestore-integration). When a new critical error is logged, trigger an agent to post the details to Slack.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to summarize a long document, then post the summary to a Slack channel for the team to review.
    * When a new lead is created in [HubSpot](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/hubspot-integration), notify the assigned sales representative via a direct message in Slack.
