  <summary>Why Integrate Twilio with Your Agent?</summary>

Twilio is a leading cloud communications platform. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build agents that can communicate with users and systems via SMS and WhatsApp.

- **Automated Notifications:** Create agents that send real-time SMS alerts for critical system events, new sales leads, or important updates, ensuring immediate notification without relying on email.
- **Transactional Messaging:** Automatically send order confirmations, shipping updates, or appointment reminders to customers via SMS or WhatsApp for a better customer experience.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Build a secure login flow where an agent generates a one-time password and sends it to a user's phone via SMS for verification.
- **Interactive Workflows:** While these components focus on sending, you can build agents that are triggered by incoming messages (via webhooks) to create interactive bots for customer support or information retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Twilio account** with a provisioned phone number (for SMS) or WhatsApp sender.
- Your Twilio **Account SID** and **Auth Token**.

## Getting Started With Twilio

The connection between SmythOS and Twilio is configured using your Account SID and Auth Token, which must be Base64 encoded.

### Step 1: Get Your Twilio Credentials
1.  Log in to the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
2.  On your main dashboard, you will find your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**. Copy both of them.

### Step 2: Base64 Encode Your Credentials
Twilio's API uses Basic Authentication. You need to combine your credentials and Base64 encode them.
1.  Combine your credentials into a single string with a colon in between: `YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`.
2.  Use a Base64 encoding tool (like the "Encode/Decode" component in SmythOS) to encode this entire string.
3.  Copy the resulting Base64 encoded string (e.g., `QUMxMjM0NTY...ZmRhNzg5`).

### Step 3: Store Your Encoded Key in SmythOS Vault
Your encoded key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.
1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your **Base64 encoded string** as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `twilio_base64_auth`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 4: Configure a Twilio Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Twilio component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the authentication field (e.g., `Base64 Encoded...`), select the secret you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Base64 encoded secret from the Vault to **each** Twilio component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Your `Account SID` and `Auth Token` provide full access to your Twilio account. Always store the Base64 encoded string in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use E.164 Format:** All phone numbers should be in E.164 format (`[+][country code][phone number]`, e.g., `+14155238886`). This is the international standard and ensures reliable message delivery.
* **Handle Message Status:** Twilio messages go through several statuses (`queued`, `sending`, `sent`, `delivered`, `failed`). For critical messages, your agent may need to poll the message status using its `messageSID` to confirm delivery.
* **Verify Numbers:** To send SMS messages from your Twilio account to a personal number during development, you must first verify that number in your Twilio Console.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Base64 encoded `Account SID:Auth Token` string is incorrect or invalid.
  * **Solution:** Carefully re-create the `Account SID:Auth Token` string, ensure there are no extra spaces, and re-encode it. Update the secret in your SmythOS Vault.

* **Error: `21211` - Invalid 'To' Phone Number**
  * **Cause:** The `recipientPhoneNumber` is not a valid phone number or is not in the correct E.164 format.
  * **Solution:** Ensure the recipient's number is correct and formatted with a `+` and the country code (e.g., `+1...`).

* **Error: `21610` - Unverified 'To' Number**
  * **Cause:** You are trying to send an SMS from a trial Twilio account to a phone number that has not been verified in your Twilio Console.
  * **Solution:** Log in to Twilio and add the recipient's number to your list of verified phone numbers.

* **WhatsApp Message Fails**
  * **Cause:** You may be trying to send a freeform message outside of the 24-hour customer service window, or your WhatsApp sender is not properly configured.
  * **Solution:** Ensure you are using an approved Message Template if initiating a conversation. Check the status of your WhatsApp sender in the Twilio Console.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful communication workflows with the **SmythOS Twilio Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Connects to your calendar. 15 minutes before a meeting, it sends an SMS reminder to all attendees.
    * Powers a password reset flow. A user requests a reset, and the agent generates a secure, one-time code and sends it to their phone via SMS.
    * Monitors an e-commerce platform. When an order ships, the agent sends a WhatsApp message to the customer with their tracking number.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Twilio with a database integration like [Firestore](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firestore-integration). When a new user record is created, trigger an agent to send them a welcome SMS.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to generate a personalized message, then use Twilio to send it to a user.
    * For two-way communication, configure a Twilio webhook to trigger a SmythOS agent when an incoming SMS is received. The agent can then process the message and reply.
