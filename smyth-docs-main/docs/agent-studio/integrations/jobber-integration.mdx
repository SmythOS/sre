  <summary>Why Integrate Jobber with Your Agent?</summary>

Jobber is a powerful tool for managing your service business. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to connect your field operations to your other systems, creating powerful, time-saving automations.

- **Automate Client Onboarding:** Create an agent that takes new lead information from a web form or your CRM and automatically creates a new client record in Jobber using the `Add Client` component.
- **Streamline Communication:** Build workflows that automatically log important communications. For example, an agent can take a summary of a customer email and use `Add Note To Client` to attach it to their Jobber profile for future reference.
- **Data Synchronization:** Keep your client list in sync across multiple platforms. An agent can use `List Clients` to get all your Jobber clients and update records in your accounting software or email marketing platform.
- **Automated Record Management:** Create cleanup agents that can `Archive Client` records for customers who haven't had a job scheduled in over a year, keeping your active client list tidy.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Jobber account**.
- **OAuth 2.0 credentials (`Client ID` and `Client Secret`)** from the Jobber Developer Center.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Jobber

The connection is handled via OAuth 2.0, which requires you to register an application in the Jobber Developer Center.

### Step 1: Get Your OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1.  **Go to the Developer Center:** Log in to your Jobber account and navigate to the [Jobber Developer Center](https://developer.getjobber.com).
2.  **Create a New App:** Navigate to the "Apps" page and click the **NEW** button.
3.  **Fill in Application Details:**
    * Give your application a **Name** (e.g., "SmythOS Workflow Automation").
    * **Redirect URI:** Enter the SmythOS callback URL: `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback`.
4.  **Copy Your Credentials:** Once created, your application's **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed. Copy both values.

### Step 2: Store Your Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your Client ID and Secret are sensitive credentials. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create new secrets for your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, giving them memorable names like `jobber_client_id` and `jobber_client_secret`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Jobber Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Jobber component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields, select the secrets you saved in the Vault.
4.  Click **Authenticate**. You will be redirected to Jobber to authorize the connection.
5.  Your connection is now ready to use across all Jobber components.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">The OAuth authentication flow connects your Jobber account to SmythOS. You only need to complete this process once.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always store your Jobber `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand the Workflow:** A common workflow is to first use `Search Clients` or `List Clients` to find the `clientId` you need, and then use that ID in other components like `Add Note To Client` or `Archive Client`.
* **Use for Data Syncing:** This integration is excellent for keeping your client list in Jobber synchronized with other systems like your CRM, accounting software, or email marketing platform.
* **Error Handling:** When creating a client, check if the request fails due to a duplicate email. Your agent's logic should be able to handle this gracefully, perhaps by fetching the existing client instead of trying to create a new one.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized` / Authentication Errors**
  * **Cause:** Your `Client ID` or `Client Secret` are incorrect, or the user did not grant consent during the OAuth flow.
  * **Solution:** Verify that your credentials in the SmythOS Vault are correct. Try re-authenticating the integration in the component settings to refresh the connection.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The authenticated user does not have the necessary permissions in Jobber to perform the requested action.
  * **Solution:** Log in to Jobber and check the permissions of the user account that was used to authenticate the integration.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect `clientId` or other identifier was provided.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Use the `Search Clients` or `List Clients` component to verify that the resource you are trying to access exists.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful service business automations with the **SmythOS Jobber Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Connects to your booking or contact form. When a new lead comes in, the agent checks if they exist with `Search Clients`. If not, it creates them with `Add Client` and then creates a new "Follow Up" task in a project management tool like [Asana](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/asana-integration).
    * Manages client communications. After a job is completed, an agent could send a follow-up survey via email using [Resend](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/resend-integration), and then log the customer's feedback as a note on their Jobber profile using `Add Note To Client`.
    * Creates a client portal. A user can interact with a chatbot, and the agent can use their email to search for their Jobber profile and provide them with information about their past or upcoming jobs.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a new client is added in Jobber, trigger an agent to also add them to an email marketing list in [Mailchimp](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/mailchimp-integration) or [Klaviyo](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/klaviyo-integration).
    * Connect Jobber to your accounting software. When a new client is created, create a corresponding customer record in your accounting platform.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to summarize a long customer email, then add the concise summary as a note to their Jobber profile.
