  <summary>Why Integrate Stability AI with Your Agent?</summary>

Stability AI is at the forefront of open-source generative AI. Integrating its models with SmythOS allows you to build powerful, automated visual content pipelines.

- **Automate Content Creation:** Generate unique, high-quality images for blog posts, social media, or ad campaigns on the fly, based on text descriptions or other data.
- **Dynamic Image Editing:** Build agents that can programmatically edit images. Automate tasks like removing backgrounds from product photos, replacing objects in lifestyle shots, or upscaling entire image libraries.
- **Enhance User-Generated Content:** Create workflows that automatically improve the quality of images uploaded by users, using upscaling and restoration models.
- **Unlock Creative Exploration:** Rapidly prototype visual concepts. Use agents to generate dozens of variations of an image based on different prompts, styles, or seeds, helping you find the perfect creative direction faster.

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Stability AI Platform account**.
- Your Stability AI **API Key**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Stability AI

The connection between SmythOS and Stability AI is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Stability AI API Key
1.  Log in to your [Stability AI Platform account](https://platform.stability.ai/).
2.  Navigate to your account page and click on the **API Keys** section. You can go there directly via `https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys`.
3.  Copy your API key. If you don't have one, create one first.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Stability AI API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `stability_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a Stability AI Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Stability AI component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `stability_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Stability AI component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Your Stability AI Secret Key grants access to your account and credits. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Master Prompting:** For all generative tasks, the prompt is the most important input. Be descriptive. Include details about subject, style, lighting, and composition. Use the `negative_prompt` to exclude unwanted elements.
* **Understand Asynchronous Workflows:** For `Creative Upscale` and `Image to Video`, you must build a two-step process in your agent. A simple approach is to add a delay after the first call, then call the "Get Result" component. For more robust workflows, use a loop to poll the result until the status is "succeeded".
* **Manage Credits:** Image and video generation consume credits from your Stability AI account. Be aware of the cost of different models and operations, and monitor your usage in your Stability AI dashboard.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, missing, or invalid.
  * **Solution:** Verify the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active in your Stability AI account.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / Validation Error**
  * **Cause:** An input is missing, has the wrong data type, or is outside the allowed range (e.g., image dimensions not divisible by 64).
  * **Solution:** Carefully check all inputs against the component's requirements. For image generation, ensure dimensions are valid. For image editing, ensure the `image_binary` is a valid file.

* **Asynchronous Job Fails or Times Out**
  * **Cause:** The generation task may have failed on Stability AI's end due to a complex prompt or resource issue, or the job is taking a very long time.
  * **Solution:** Check the status of the job via the raw `Response` from the "Get Result" component. If it remains in a "processing" state for an extended period or fails, try the request again with a simpler prompt or different settings. Check Stability AI's status page for any ongoing issues.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful visual automation workflows with the **SmythOS Stability AI Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Automatically generates featured images for new blog posts based on the post's title and a summary.
    * Creates a product personalization tool. A user uploads a photo of their room, and the agent uses `Search and Replace` to show how a new piece of furniture would look in their space.
    * Monitors a folder for new product photos, automatically removes the background, upscales the image, and then creates a short animated video of the product for social media.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to generate creative, detailed prompts to feed into Stability AI's text-to-image components.
    * Generate an image with Stability AI and then use a voice from [Elevenlabs](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/elevenlabs-integration) to describe it.
    * Create a workflow where users can describe an image in a chat, and the agent generates it and sends it back via [Slack](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/slack-integration).
