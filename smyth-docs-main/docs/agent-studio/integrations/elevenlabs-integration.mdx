  <summary>Why Integrate Elevenlabs with Your Agent?</summary>

Elevenlabs provides state-of-the-art AI voice synthesis. By integrating it with SmythOS, you can build agents that communicate not just with text, but with high-quality, natural-sounding speech.

- **Automate Voiceovers:** Create agents that take a script from a document or an AI's output and automatically generate a voiceover for videos, presentations, or podcasts.
- **Enhance Accessibility:** Build workflows that convert written content, like blog posts or reports, into audio format, making your content accessible to a wider audience.
- **Create Dynamic Audio Alerts:** Move beyond text-based notifications. Have your agents generate spoken alerts for critical system events, new leads, or important updates.
- **Personalized Audio Content:** Generate personalized audio messages at scale. An agent could create custom audio greetings, summaries, or reminders for each user in a list.

## Getting Started With Elevenlabs

The connection between SmythOS and Elevenlabs is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your Elevenlabs API Key
1.  Log in to your [Elevenlabs account](https://elevenlabs.io/).
2.  Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
3.  Select **Profile + API Key**.
4.  Your API Key will be displayed. Copy it to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Elevenlabs API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `elevenlabs_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure the Elevenlabs Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Text to Speech** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `elevenlabs_api_key`).
4.  Configure other settings like `Model ID` as needed.
5.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to each Elevenlabs component you use. This ensures all connections are secure and properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Elevenlabs Component Should I Use?

| If you need toâ€¦ | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Convert any text into an audio file** | A string of text | [Text to Speech](#text-to-speech) | This is the core component for all voice synthesis tasks with Elevenlabs. |

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the Elevenlabs component.

### <a name="text-to-speech"></a>Text to Speech
Converts a string of text into a high-quality audio file using a selected voice.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-elevenlabs) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Component-Specific Settings
In the component's settings panel, you can fine-tune the audio output:
- **Model ID:** Select the speech synthesis model to use. Different models offer various languages and voice characteristics.
- **Similarity Boost:** A slider to control how closely the output voice matches the selected voice model. Higher values increase similarity but may affect naturalness.
- **Stability:** A slider to control the consistency of the voice. Higher values produce a more monotonic, steady voice, while lower values allow for more expression.
- **Style:** A slider to exaggerate the selected voice's speaking style.

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | Yes | The text you want to convert into speech. |
| `voice_id` | string | Yes | The unique ID of the voice to use for generation. You can find voice IDs in your Elevenlabs VoiceLab. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `url` | string | A temporary URL pointing to the generated audio file. |
| `Response`| binary | The raw binary data of the generated MP3 audio file. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response, containing details like content type and size. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
Create a "read it for me" agent. The agent scrapes the text content of a blog post, passes it to the `text` input of this component, and returns the audio `url` so the user can listen to the article.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "elevenlabs.textToSpeech",
  "text": "Hello, world! This is an audio message generated automatically by a SmythOS agent.",
  "voice_id": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Character Limits & Costs">
Your Elevenlabs plan will have a character quota. Long text inputs will consume more of your monthly quota. Be mindful of this when processing large documents.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your Elevenlabs API key.
* **Experiment with Voices and Settings:** The best way to get the perfect audio output is to test different `voice_id`s and tweak the `Stability` and `Similarity Boost` settings. What works for a news report might not work for a friendly notification.
* **Chunk Large Texts:** For very long documents, consider splitting the text into smaller chunks (e.g., paragraphs) and generating audio for each one. This can prevent timeouts and provide more control over the final audio composition.
* **Manage Your Quota:** Keep an eye on your character usage in your Elevenlabs dashboard, especially if you are running agents that process large volumes of text.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API key is missing, invalid, or disabled.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your Elevenlabs profile. Ensure your account is active.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required` / Quota Exceeded**
  * **Cause:** You have used up your monthly character quota.
  * **Solution:** Check your usage and quota in your Elevenlabs dashboard. You may need to wait for the next billing cycle or upgrade your plan.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` (e.g., "Voice not found")**
  * **Cause:** The `voice_id` provided does not exist or your account does not have access to it.
  * **Solution:** Double-check the `voice_id` from your Elevenlabs VoiceLab. Ensure there are no typos.

* **Audio Quality Issues**
  * **Cause:** The `Stability` and `Similarity Boost` settings might not be optimal for the chosen voice and text.
  * **Solution:** Adjust the sliders in the component settings. Try lowering similarity or increasing stability for a more consistent output, or vice-versa for more expression.

## What's Next?

You're now ready to build engaging, voice-enabled workflows with the **SmythOS Elevenlabs Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Fetches top headlines from the [NewsAPI Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/newsapi-integration), and generates a daily audio news briefing.
    * Connects to your calendar, checks your schedule for the next day, and generates a personalized "good morning" audio summary of your appointments.
    * Monitors a customer support inbox, and when an urgent ticket arrives, generates a spoken alert that is played over an office speaker system.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Elevenlabs with AI text generation components. Have an AI write a summary of a long report, then have Elevenlabs read that summary aloud.
    * Use the [ScrapingBee Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/scrapingbee-integration) to extract text from a website and pass it directly to the Text to Speech component.
    * Store the generated audio files in a cloud service like [OneDrive](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/onedrive-integration) for long-term access.
