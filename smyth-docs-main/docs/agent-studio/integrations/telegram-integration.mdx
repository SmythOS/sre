  <summary>Why Integrate Telegram with Your Agent?</summary>

Telegram is a popular and secure messaging platform. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that communicate effectively and deliver information instantly.

- **Automated Alerting:** Create agents that monitor your systems, applications, or websites. When a critical event occurs (like a server going down), the agent can instantly send an alert to a dedicated Telegram channel for your on-call team.
- **Centralized Notifications:** Consolidate notifications from various tools. Instead of checking multiple dashboards, have your agents send updates from your CRM, project management tool, and CI/CD pipeline into a single, organized Telegram chat.
- **Content Distribution:** Build an agent that monitors your blog's RSS feed. When a new article is published, it can automatically send a message with the title and link to your public Telegram channel.
- **Interactive Workflows:** While these components focus on sending, you can build agents that are triggered by incoming messages via a webhook, allowing you to create interactive bots for support, Q&A, or internal tools.

## Getting Started With Telegram

The connection between SmythOS and Telegram is configured using a secure Bot Token, which you get from a special bot called the BotFather.

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot and Get Your Token
1.  **Start a chat with BotFather:** Open your Telegram app and search for the user `@BotFather` (it will have a blue checkmark). Start a chat with it.
2.  **Create a new bot:** Type the command `/newbot` and send it.
3.  **Name your bot:** BotFather will ask for a name for your bot (e.g., "SmythOS Notifier").
4.  **Choose a username:** Next, choose a username for your bot. It must be unique and end in "bot" (e.g., `SmythOSNotifierBot`).
5.  **Copy your Bot Token:** BotFather will congratulate you and provide you with a token. It will look something like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`. **Copy this token immediately.**

### Step 2: Store Your Bot Token in SmythOS Vault
Your Bot Token is a highly sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Telegram Bot Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `telegram_bot_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Telegram Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Telegram component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Bot Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `telegram_bot_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured.

### Step 4: Get Your Chat ID
To send a message, you need the ID of the chat, group, or channel you want to send it to.
- **For a person or group:** Add your bot to the group or start a chat with it. You can then use a tool or another bot like `@userinfobot` to find the chat ID.
- **For a channel:** Add your bot as an administrator to the channel. The chat ID will be the channel's username, prefixed with `@` (e.g., `@mychannel`).

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Bot Token from the Vault to **each** Telegram component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Telegram Component Should I Use?

| If you need toâ€¦ | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Bot Token:** Your Bot Token grants full control over your bot. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault`. If it's ever exposed, revoke it immediately via BotFather.
* **Understand Chat IDs:** A positive `chat_id` is for a private chat with a user. A negative `chat_id` is for a group or supergroup. For public channels, you can use the `@channelusername` format.
* **Use Formatting for Readability:** Leverage Markdown or HTML in your messages to make them clearer and more engaging. Use bold text for alerts, create lists for summaries, and embed links for more context.
* **Bot Permissions:** If sending to a group or channel, ensure your bot has been added as a member (and as an admin if necessary) and has permission to send messages.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Bot Token is incorrect, invalid, or has been revoked.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the token in your SmythOS Vault is correct. If needed, use the `/revoke` command in BotFather to invalidate the old token and generate a new one.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / "chat not found"**
  * **Cause:** The `chat_id` is incorrect, or the bot is not a member of the target chat/channel.
  * **Solution:** Verify the `chat_id` is correct. For groups, ensure you have invited the bot to the group. For private chats, the user must have initiated a conversation with the bot first.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden` / "bot was kicked from the group chat"**
  * **Cause:** The bot was removed from the group or channel it's trying to post to.
  * **Solution:** Re-invite the bot to the target group or channel.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful notification and communication workflows with the **SmythOS Telegram Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Creates a daily weather report. It fetches data from a weather API and sends a formatted summary to a family group chat on Telegram.
    * Monitors a stock price. If the price drops below a certain threshold, the agent sends an urgent alert to a private channel for traders.
    * Generates a weekly podcast summary. The agent transcribes a podcast using a speech-to-text service, uses an LLM to summarize it, and sends the summary along with a link to the audio file to a subscriber channel.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Telegram with a database integration like [Firestore](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firestore-integration). When a new high-priority item is added to the database, trigger an agent to send a notification to the relevant team on Telegram.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to draft a social media post, then send it to a private Telegram channel for approval before it's published with [Ayrshare](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration).
    * Connect your e-commerce store. When a new order ships, send the customer a shipping confirmation and tracking number via a Telegram message.
