## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **DataForSEO account**.
- Your DataForSEO API `login` and `password` (API key).

<Divider />

## Getting Started With DataForSEO

Authentication for DataForSEO uses your API login and password, combined and encoded in Base64 format.

### Step 1: Get Your DataForSEO API Credentials
1.  Log in to your [DataForSEO Dashboard](https://app.dataforseo.com/api-dashboard).
2.  Your API credentials (`login` and `password`) are displayed on this page. Copy both of them.

### Step 2: Encode Your Credentials in Base64
The API requires your credentials to be in the format `login:password` and then Base64 encoded.
1.  Combine your credentials into a single string with a colon in between. For example: `my_email@example.com:your_password`.
2.  Use an online tool or a local script to Base64 encode this string. The example `my_email@example.com:your_password` would become something like `bXlfZW1haWxAZXhhbXBsZS5jb206eW91cl9wYXNzd29yZA==`.
3.  Copy the resulting Base64 encoded string.

### Step 3: Store Your Encoded Key in SmythOS Vault
Your encoded key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your **Base64 encoded string** as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `dataforseo_base64_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 4: Configure a DataForSEO Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any DataForSEO component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Base64 Encoded Login and Password` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `dataforseo_base64_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Base64 encoded key from the Vault to **each** DataForSEO component you use. This ensures all connections are secure.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Your DataForSEO login and password are the keys to your account. Always Base64 encode them and store the result securely in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Manage API Costs:** DataForSEO operates on a pay-per-use model. Be mindful of how frequently your agents run and how many results they request to manage your budget.
* **Use Location and Language:** For accurate, targeted results, always specify the `location_name` and `language_name`. The defaults may not be suitable for your audience.
* **Parse the `result` Array:** The data you need is inside the `result` array in the output. You will need to loop through this array and check the `type` of each item (e.g., `organic`, `video`, `news_result`) to process the data correctly.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Base64 encoded credential string is incorrect, or your DataForSEO account has an issue.
  * **Solution:** Carefully re-encode your `login:password` string, ensuring there are no extra spaces. Verify your credentials are correct and your account is active in the DataForSEO dashboard.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required` / Insufficient funds**
  * **Cause:** Your DataForSEO account balance is too low to cover the cost of the API call.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your DataForSEO account and add funds to your balance.

* **Empty `result` Array**
  * **Cause:** The query genuinely returned no results for the specified parameters.
  * **Solution:** Test the keyword, location, and language combination in your browser to confirm. Try a broader keyword or location to ensure the API connection is working.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to harness real-time search data with the **SmythOS DataForSEO Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Tracks a list of 20 keywords daily across 3 different countries, and logs the top-ranking URL for each into a centralized Google Sheet.
    * Monitors Google News for your company's name. If a new article appears, use an AI component to summarize it and post the summary and link to a dedicated Slack channel.
    * Analyzes the YouTube SERP for a "how-to" keyword, identifies the top 5 ranking videos, and extracts their titles and channels for competitive research.

* **Explore Other Integrations:** Combine DataForSEO with other SmythOS connectors. Send SERP data to [Google Sheets](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for analysis, use it to trigger [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration) alerts, or pass URLs you find to the [Ahrefs Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ahrefs-integration) to check their backlink profiles.
