  <summary>Why Integrate WordPress.com with Your Agent?</summary>

WordPress.com is a powerful platform for publishing. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build sophisticated, automated content pipelines.

- **Automated Content Creation & Syndication:** Create agents that take content from a Notion page, a Google Doc, or even an AI model's output and automatically create drafts or publish new posts on your WordPress.com site.
- **Content Synchronization:** Keep your content consistent across platforms. An agent can monitor an external source of truth (like a product database) and use the `Edit Post` component to ensure your WordPress.com pages are always up-to-date.
- **Streamlined Editorial Workflows:** Build an agent that takes a newly created draft, sends a notification to an editor for approval, and once approved (based on a signal from another tool), automatically publishes the post by updating its status.
- **Programmatic Content Management:** Go beyond the WordPress dashboard. Use agents to perform bulk updates, delete old posts based on specific criteria, or manage content across multiple sites from a single interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **WordPress.com account** and site.
- **OAuth 2.0 credentials (`Client ID` and `Client Secret`)** from the WordPress.com Developer portal.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With WordPress.com

The connection is handled via OAuth 2.0, which requires you to register an application in the WordPress.com Developer portal.

### Step 1: Get Your OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1.  **Go to the Developer Portal:** Log in to your WordPress.com account and navigate to the [Developer Apps page](https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/).
2.  **Create a New Application:** Click the **Create New Application** button.
3.  **Fill in Application Details:**
    * Give your application a **Name** (e.g., "SmythOS Content Agent").
    * Provide a **Description** and your **Website URL**.
    * **Redirect URL:** Enter the SmythOS callback URL: `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback`.
4.  **Copy Your Credentials:** Once created, your application's **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed. Copy both values immediately.

### Step 2: Store Your Credentials in SmythOS Vault
Your Client ID and Secret are sensitive credentials. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store them securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create new secrets for your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, giving them memorable names like `wordpress_client_id` and `wordpress_client_secret`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a WordPress.com Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any WordPress.com component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields, select the secrets you saved in the Vault.
4.  Click **Authenticate**. You will be redirected to WordPress.com to authorize the connection.
5.  Your connection is now ready to use across all WordPress.com components.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">The OAuth authentication flow connects your WordPress.com account to SmythOS. You only need to complete this process once.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always store your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use the `Body` for Advanced Operations:** The `Create Post` and `Edit Post` components are much more powerful when you use the `Body` setting. You can specify tags, categories, status (`draft`, `pending`, `publish`), and more by constructing the appropriate JSON object according to the [WordPress.com REST API documentation](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/1.1/post/sites/$site/posts/new/).
* **Manage Site and Post IDs:** Your agent workflows will often require a `site` identifier and a `post_id`. The `site` is your site's domain. You can get `post_id`s from the `Create Post` or `Get Posts` components.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized` / Authentication Errors**
  * **Cause:** Your `Client ID` or `Client Secret` are incorrect, or the user did not properly grant consent during the OAuth flow.
  * **Solution:** Verify your credentials in the SmythOS Vault. Try re-authenticating the integration in the component settings.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The authenticated user does not have the necessary permissions (e.g., Editor or Administrator role) on the target WordPress.com site to perform the action.
  * **Solution:** Check the user's role on the WordPress.com site. Ensure they have the authority to publish or edit posts.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `site` identifier or `post_id` is incorrect.
  * **Solution:** Double-check your site domain and the ID of the post you are trying to interact with.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful content publishing workflows with the **SmythOS WordPress.com Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a content syndication engine, monitoring an RSS feed and automatically creating draft posts on your WordPress.com site whenever a new item appears.
    * Connects to your social media. When you post a long-form update on another platform, an agent takes that content and creates a more detailed blog post on WordPress.com.
    * Generates articles with an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration), then uses `Create Post` to save them as drafts for human review and publication.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * After an agent publishes a new post, it can take the post URL from the output and share it across your social channels using the [Ayrshare Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration).
    * Keep a content inventory by having your agent log the ID and URL of every new post to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) or [Notion](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/notion-integration) database.
