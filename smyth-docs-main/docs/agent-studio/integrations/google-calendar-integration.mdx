## Why Integrate Google Calendar with Your Agent?

Google Calendar is a powerful tool for time management and scheduling. By integrating it with SmythOS, you empower your agents to interact with your calendar programmatically, unlocking significant automation potential.

- **Automate Event Creation:** Agents can schedule meetings, block out time, or create reminders in Google Calendar based on triggers from other systems or agent logic (e.g., creating a follow-up event after a customer interaction).
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Agents can read calendar availability to make intelligent scheduling decisions, preventing conflicts and finding optimal times for events or resource allocation.
- **Centralized Event Logging:** Use Google Calendar as a log for important time-stamped events generated by your automated processes, providing a clear, chronological view.
- **Real-time Updates:** Enable agents to update event details (like status, attendees, or location) as circumstances change within your workflows.

Essentially, this integration transforms your Google Calendar from a static scheduling tool into an intelligent, interactive part of your SmythOS ecosystem. The result? Less manual effort, fewer scheduling errors, timely information, and more capacity for your team to focus on strategic tasks.

  <summary>Why Integrate Google Calendar with Your Agent?</summary>

Google Calendar is a cornerstone for managing time and events. Integrating it with SmythOS allows your agents to become active participants in your scheduling and time management processes. Each component is designed for a specific calendar operation:

- **Automate Event Creation:** Let agents automatically schedule project kick-offs, client follow-ups, or internal reminders directly in team members' calendars when certain conditions are met in your workflows.
- **Intelligent Availability Checks:** Before committing to a new task or scheduling a resource, agents can query Google Calendar via the "List Events" component to check for existing commitments, preventing double-bookings.
- **Synchronized Task Management:** If your agent manages tasks with deadlines, it can create corresponding events in Google Calendar to ensure visibility and timely reminders.
- **Automated Meeting Updates:** Agents can modify existing events—for instance, adding a meeting link generated by another service, updating the attendee list, or changing the event status—based on real-time information.

By connecting Google Calendar, you reduce manual data entry, minimize scheduling conflicts, and ensure that your calendar accurately reflects the activities and commitments managed by your automated SmythOS agents.

## Prerequisites: What You'll Need to Get Started

Before you begin the integration, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. (If you're new to SmythOS, [you can sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup).)
- A **Google Account** that has access to the Google Calendar(s) you plan to use.
- You will need to generate **OAuth 2.0 credentials (`Client ID` and `Client Secret`)** from the Google Cloud Console. This process also involves configuring an OAuth consent screen and enabling the Google Calendar API. Detailed steps are provided below.
- The **Authorized redirect URI** for SmythOS, which is: `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback` (You'll need this when creating credentials in Google Cloud Console).

## Step-by-Step: Connecting Your Google Calendar Account

Let's establish the connection between SmythOS and your Google Calendar. This involves obtaining OAuth 2.0 credentials from Google and then using them to authenticate within SmythOS. This is typically a one-time setup per Google account you wish to integrate.

### Part A: Obtaining Your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from Google Cloud Console

1.  **Navigate to Google Cloud Console:**
    * Go to `https://console.cloud.google.com/`.
    * Sign in with the Google account that owns or has administrative access to the Google Calendar(s) you intend to use.
    * If you don't have a project, create a new one. Otherwise, select an existing project.

2.  **Enable the Google Calendar API:**
    * In the search bar at the top, type "Google Calendar API" and select it from the results under "Marketplace."
    * On the Google Calendar API page, click the `Enable` button. If it's already enabled, you can proceed to the next step.

3.  **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen:**
    * In the left-hand navigation menu (or by searching), go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen."
    * **User Type:**
        * Choose "Internal" if your app is only for users within your Google Workspace organization.
        * Choose "External" if you want any Google user (including yourself with a personal Gmail account) to be able to authorize the app. If you select "External" and your app is not yet published, it will be in "testing" mode, and you'll need to add test users.
    * Click `Create`.
    * **App Information:**
        * **App name:** Enter a descriptive name, e.g., "SmythOS Calendar Integration."
        * **User support email:** Select your email address.
        * **App logo (Optional):** Upload a logo if desired.
        * **Developer contact information:** Enter your email address.
    * Click `Save and Continue`.
    * **Scopes:** Click `Add or Remove Scopes`.
        * In the filter, search for "Google Calendar API."
        * Select the necessary scopes. For full functionality (create, read, update, delete events), you'll typically need:
            * `.../auth/calendar` (Manage primary calendar and other calendars you have access to)
            * `.../auth/calendar.events` (View and edit events on all your calendars)
        * *Best Practice: Only request scopes that are essential for the actions your agents will perform. For example, if agents only need to read events, `.../auth/calendar.events.readonly` might be sufficient.*
        * Click `Update` after selecting scopes.
    * Click `Save and Continue`.
    * **Test Users (if "External" and in testing mode):**
        * Click `+ Add Users`.
        * Enter the email addresses of the Google accounts that will be used to test this integration (including your own if it's a personal account).
    * Click `Save and Continue`.
    * Review the summary page and click `Back to Dashboard`. *(Your app might remain in "testing" mode unless you go through Google's verification process, which is usually not necessary for internal tools or limited user bases).*

4.  **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
    * Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."
    * Click `+ Create Credentials` at the top and select `OAuth client ID`.
    * **Application type:** Select `Web application` from the dropdown.
    * **Name:** Give your OAuth client ID a descriptive name, e.g., "SmythOS Calendar Web Client."
    * **Authorized redirect URIs:**
        * Click `+ Add URI`.
        * Enter the SmythOS callback URL: `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`
        * *This URI must be an exact match.*
    * Click `Create`.

5.  **Copy Your Credentials:**
    * A dialog box will appear showing **Your Client ID** and **Your Client Secret**.
    * **Copy both of these values immediately and store them securely.** You will need them in the next part to configure the integration in SmythOS.
    <WarningCallout title="Secure Your Credentials!"> Your `Client ID` and especially your `Client Secret` are sensitive. Treat them like passwords. Do not embed them directly in agent code if avoidable, share them in public forums, or commit them to version control. SmythOS offers a `Vault` for secure credential storage. [Learn more about SmythOS Vault here.](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) </WarningCallout>

### Part B: Authenticating in SmythOS

1.  **Navigate to SmythOS Integrations:** In your SmythOS dashboard, find and click on the "Integrations" section.
2.  **Add or Configure Google Calendar Integration:**
    * Look for "Google Calendar" in the list of available integrations and click to add or configure it.
3.  **Enter Your OAuth Credentials:**
    * You will see fields to input the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` that you obtained from the Google Cloud Console in Part A.
    * Carefully paste these values into the respective fields.
4.  **Initiate Authentication:**
    * Click the `Authenticate` button within the SmythOS Google Calendar integration settings.
5.  **Google Authorization Flow:**
    * You will be redirected to a Google Sign-In page. Log in using the Google account you want to connect with SmythOS (this should be an account you added as a "test user" if your OAuth app is in testing mode and "External").
    * Google will then display a consent screen, showing the name of your app (e.g., "SmythOS Calendar Integration") and the permissions it's requesting (based on the scopes you configured). Review these permissions.
    * Click `Allow` or `Grant` to authorize SmythOS to access your Google Calendar data.
6.  **Redirection to SmythOS:**
    * After successful authorization, you'll be redirected back to SmythOS.
    * The Google Calendar integration should now indicate that it's connected and authenticated. **Connection Confirmed!**

<InfoCallout title="Switching Google Accounts or Reconnecting?" collapsible > If you ever need to connect a different Google Account or refresh an existing connection, you can typically find a `Sign Out`, `Disconnect`, or `Deauthenticate` button within the Google Calendar integration settings in SmythOS. After deauthenticating, simply repeat the authentication steps (Part B, and potentially Part A if credentials change or scopes need updating) with the new account. </InfoCallout>

## Google Calendar Components: An Overview

With your Google Account successfully linked, you gain access to a range of Google Calendar components within SmythOS. These components are specialized tools your agents can use to perform specific operations on your calendars.

Click any component name to jump directly to its detailed guide. Here’s what's available:

| Component | Action Type | Summary |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| [Create Event](#create-event) | Write | Adds a new event to a calendar.<br /><Badge type="required" /> `calendarId`, `summary`, `start`, `end` |
| [Get Event](#get-event) | Read | Retrieves details for a specific event.<br /><Badge type="required" /> `calendarId`, `eventId` |
| [List Events](#list-events) | Read | Fetches a list of events from a calendar, optionally filtered by time or query.<br /><Badge type="required" /> `calendarId` |
| [Patch Update Event](#patch-update-event) | Write | Modifies specific fields of an existing event.<br /><Badge type="required" /> `calendarId`, `eventId`, `Body` |
| [Delete Event](#delete-event) | Write | Removes an event from a calendar.<br /><Badge type="required" /> `calendarId`, `eventId` |

<InfoCallout title="Good to Know!"> That initial authentication you performed (OAuth 2.0 setup) covers **all** these components. You won't need to re-authenticate or re-enter your Client ID/Secret for each individual component you use with the connected Google account. </InfoCallout>

  "q": "Weekly Sync",
  "singleEvents": true,
  "orderBy": "startTime",
  "maxResults": 20
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Troubleshooting"> 
- **Time Zone for `timeMin`/`timeMax`:** Ensure these RFC3339 timestamps correctly specify UTC (`Z`) or an offset if not UTC, to avoid incorrect date ranges.
- **`singleEvents=false` (default):** If you're querying a date range and not seeing individual instances of recurring events, set `singleEvents` to `true`.
- **Pagination:** For more than `maxResults` events, you'll need to implement logic to use the `nextPageToken` from the `Response` to fetch subsequent pages. 
</WarningCallout>

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `event` | The full, updated Google Calendar Event resource object. See [Common Output Fields (Event Object Structure)](#common-output-fields-event-object-structure). |
| `Response` | Raw API payload from Google. |
| `Headers` | HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible> A meeting's location changes from a physical room to a virtual meeting. An agent uses "Patch Update Event" to change the `location` field and update the `description` with the new meeting link, without altering the original summary, time, or attendee list. </TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "googleCalendar.patchUpdateEvent",
  "calendarId": "primary",
  "eventId": "eventtoupdate123",
  "Body": {
    "summary": "Updated: Project Review",
    "location": "Online - Google Meet (Link in description)",
    "description": "Project review meeting. New Google Meet link: https://meet.google.com/xyz-abc-pqr",
    "start": {
      "dateTime": "2025-09-20T14:30:00-07:00",
      "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles"
    },
    "end": {
      "dateTime": "2025-09-20T15:30:00-07:00",
      "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles"
    }
  },
  "sendNotifications": true
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Troubleshooting"> 
- **Modifying Attendees:** To add, remove, or change attendee status, provide the complete new `attendees` array in the `Body`. Patching individual attendees within the array is not directly supported; you replace the entire array.
- **Permissions:** Ensure write access to the `calendarId`.
- **`conferenceDataVersion`:** If updating conference data (e.g., changing a Meet link), you might need to set `conferenceDataVersion: 1` in the input to signal the API to process these changes. 
</WarningCallout>

#### Outputs
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Response` | Raw API payload from Google. Usually empty for a successful delete operation (HTTP 204 No Content). |
| `Headers` | HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible> If a project is cancelled, an agent can automatically find all associated future meetings using "List Events" (e.g., by searching for the project name in the summary) and then use "Delete Event" in a loop to remove them from the calendar, optionally notifying attendees. </TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "googleCalendar.deleteEvent",
  "calendarId": "primary",
  "eventId": "eventtodelete789",
  "sendNotifications": true
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Troubleshooting"> 
- **Irreversible Action:** Event deletion is permanent. Ensure you have the correct `eventId`.
- **Permissions:** The authenticated user must have write access to the `calendarId` to delete events.
- **Recurring Events:** Deleting an instance of a recurring event might have different behavior (e.g., deleting just that instance, or the instance and all following) depending on Google Calendar's API handling for that specific event type. Test thoroughly. 
</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

To make the most of your Google Calendar integration with SmythOS, consider these tips:

* **Minimal Scopes:** During OAuth setup in Google Cloud Console, only request the API scopes that your agents absolutely need (e.g., `.../auth/calendar.events.readonly` if only reading events, or `.../auth/calendar.events` for full read/write). This enhances security by limiting potential access.
* **Idempotency:** For operations like "Create Event," especially in workflows that might be retried, design your agent logic to prevent duplicate event creations. This could involve:
    * Storing the `eventId` of created events in SmythOS Vault or a database.
    * Using the `iCalUID` field: You can either provide your own `iCalUID` during event creation or use the one Google generates to check for existing events.
* **Time Zones are Critical:**
    * When specifying `start.dateTime` and `end.dateTime`, always include the `start.timeZone` and `end.timeZone` fields with valid IANA time zone names (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`).
    * For `timeMin` and `timeMax` in "List Events," use UTC (`Z` suffix) or include the correct timezone offset in your RFC3339 timestamps to ensure accurate filtering across different time zones.
* **`singleEvents=true` for "List Events":** When querying for events within a date range, setting `singleEvents: true` is highly recommended. This expands instances of recurring events, ensuring your agent sees all actual occurrences within the period.
* **Error Handling & `Response` Object:** Always check component outputs for errors. The `Response` object (raw API payload from Google) often contains detailed error messages that are invaluable for debugging.
* **Use "Patch Update Event" for Modifications:** When changing an existing event, "Patch Update Event" is generally preferred over a full update (if one were available) because it only modifies the fields you specify, reducing the risk of unintentionally overwriting other details.
* **Notifications (`sendNotifications`):** Be mindful of the `sendNotifications` parameter in components like "Create Event," "Patch Update Event," and "Delete Event." Use it to control whether attendees receive email notifications, which can be crucial for user experience.
* **Pagination for "List Events":** If you expect "List Events" to return more events than your `maxResults` limit (or the default of 250), you must implement logic to handle pagination using the `nextPageToken` found in the `Response` object of the previous call.
* **Conference Data (`conferenceData`):** Utilize the `conferenceData` input in "Create Event" or "Patch Update Event" to automatically create or manage video conferencing links (like Google Meet) for your events. Ensure you provide a unique `requestId` for `createRequest`.
* **Rate Limiting:** Be aware of Google Calendar API usage quotas. If your agents perform many calendar operations in a short period, you might encounter rate limits. Design workflows to be efficient, and implement retry logic with backoff if necessary.
* **Testing with Non-Primary Calendars:** If interacting with shared or resource calendars, thoroughly test permissions and `calendarId` usage. `primary` only works for the authenticated user's main calendar.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Encountering an issue with your Google Calendar integration? Here are solutions to some common problems:

* **Authentication Errors (e.g., `invalid_client`, `redirect_uri_mismatch`, `access_denied`):**
    * **Possible Cause(s):** Incorrect `Client ID` or `Client Secret` entered in SmythOS; "Authorized redirect URIs" in Google Cloud Console not matching `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback` exactly; user denied permissions during the Google consent screen.
    * **Solution(s):**
        1.  Verify `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in SmythOS match Google Cloud Console.
        2.  Ensure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console is `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`.
        3.  If `access_denied`, the user must re-authenticate and grant the requested permissions.
        4.  Ensure the Google User account used for authentication is added as a "Test User" in GCP OAuth Consent Screen settings if the app is in "testing" mode and "External".

* **`403 Forbidden` / Permission Denied Errors when using components:**
    * **Possible Cause(s):** The authenticated Google account lacks necessary permissions for the target `calendarId`, or the required API scopes were not requested/granted during OAuth setup.
    * **Solution(s):**
        1.  In Google Calendar, check the sharing settings for the `calendarId` in question. Ensure the authenticated Google account has appropriate access rights (e.g., "Make changes to events" for creating/updating, or "See all event details" for reading).
        2.  In Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen." Edit your app registration, go to "Scopes," and ensure all necessary scopes (e.g., `.../auth/calendar.events`, `.../auth/calendar`) are listed and saved.
        3.  After updating scopes in Google Cloud Console, you may need to de-authenticate and re-authenticate the Google Calendar integration within SmythOS.

* **`404 Not Found` Errors (for "Get Event," "Patch Update Event," "Delete Event"):**
    * **Possible Cause(s):** The provided `eventId` is incorrect, does not exist in the specified `calendarId`, or the authenticated user lacks permission to see that specific event (even if they have access to the calendar).
    * **Solution(s):** Double-check the `eventId` for typos. Confirm the event exists in the correct `calendarId`. Ensure the authenticated user has at least view access to that particular event.

* **Incorrect `calendarId` Usage:**
    * **Possible Cause(s):** Using an invalid calendar ID format or an ID for a calendar the authenticated user cannot access.
    * **Solution(s):** Remember `primary` is a special keyword for the authenticated user's main calendar. For other calendars, use their full ID (often an email address for user/group calendars, or a long string for resource calendars). Verify access permissions.

* **Invalid Date/Time Formats or Time Zone Issues:**
    * **Possible Cause(s):** `start` or `end` date/time objects are not in RFC3339 format; `timeZone` is missing when `dateTime` is used; `timeMin`/`timeMax` for "List Events" have incorrect timezone handling.
    * **Solution(s):**
        1.  For `dateTime` fields: Use `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` (for UTC) or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm` (with offset). Example: `2025-10-23T10:00:00-07:00`.
        2.  Always include the `timeZone` field (e.g., `"America/Los_Angeles"`) within the `start` and `end` objects if using `dateTime` to represent local time.
        3.  For all-day events: Use `date` with `YYYY-MM-DD` format. E.g., `"start": {"date": "2025-10-23"}`.
        4.  For `timeMin`/`timeMax` in "List Events," it's safest to use UTC (`Z`) to avoid ambiguity unless you are certain about local time handling.

* **Events Not Appearing in "List Events" as Expected:**
    * **Possible Cause(s):** `singleEvents` is `false` (default) for recurring events; `timeMin`/`timeMax` range is incorrect or affected by time zones; search query `q` is too restrictive; pagination not handled.
    * **Solution(s):** Set `singleEvents: true` for date range queries. Verify `timeMin`/`timeMax` RFC3339 timestamps and their time zones. Test with a broader query or no query. Check `Response.nextPageToken` for more results.

## What's Next?

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the **SmythOS Google Calendar integration** and explored its powerful components. You're now equipped to build agents that can intelligently interact with your calendar data, automating scheduling, reminders, and event management.

Consider these next steps on your journey:

* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Monitors a CRM for new "Closed-Won" deals and automatically schedules a "Client Onboarding" meeting in the account manager's calendar using "Create Event," inviting the client and attaching relevant documents in the description.
    * Allows team members to request vacation time via a SmythOS form. The agent checks the team calendar for conflicts ("List Events"), then, if approved, creates an all-day event for the vacation period.
    * Sends a personalized daily agenda to users via Slack or email, by fetching today's events ("List Events") and formatting the information.
    * Listens for webhook events from a project management tool. When a task deadline is updated, the agent uses "List Events" to find the corresponding calendar event (perhaps by searching a unique ID in the description) and then "Patch Update Event" to adjust its due date.
* **Combine with Other SmythOS Integrations:**
    * Use [Google Gmail Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration) to send customized email notifications or follow-ups related to calendar events created or managed by your agents.
    * Trigger calendar events based on data received from SmythOS database connectors or other third-party API integrations.
    * Update a central dashboard or log file (e.g., using Google Sheets Integration) with details of calendar events managed by your agents for reporting or auditing.

Explore the possibilities, and happy automating!
