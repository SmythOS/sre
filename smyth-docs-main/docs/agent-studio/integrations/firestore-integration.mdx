  <summary>Why Integrate Firestore with Your Agent?</summary>

Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL database perfect for building modern applications. Integrating it with SmythOS allows your agents to have a powerful, persistent memory and data backend.

- **Automate Data Management:** Create agents that can automatically save, retrieve, and manage data. Log application events, store user preferences, or manage content for a CMS, all programmatically.
- **Build Application Backends:** Use SmythOS agents as the serverless backend for your web or mobile apps. An agent can handle user data, process requests, and interact with your Firestore database, all in one place.
- **Create a Persistent Memory for Agents:** Allow agents to remember information across conversations and executions by storing state and context in a Firestore document.
- **Data-Driven Workflows:** Trigger agents based on database changes (using Firestore Triggers and a webhook) or have agents make decisions based on the data they retrieve from your collections.

## Getting Started With Firestore

The connection between SmythOS and Firestore is handled via OAuth 2.0. This requires a one-time setup in the Google Cloud Console to get your credentials.

### Step 1: Get Your OAuth 2.0 Credentials from Google
1.  **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
    * Navigate to `https://console.cloud.google.com/` and select your project.
2.  **Enable the Firestore API:**
    * In the search bar, find "Cloud Firestore API" and **Enable** it for your project.
3.  **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
    * Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
    * Choose **External** for User Type and click `Create`.
    * Fill in the required app information (App name, User support email, Developer contact).
    * **Scopes:** Click `Add or Remove Scopes`, search for "firestore", and add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore`. Click `Update`. This scope allows full access to Firestore.
    * **Test Users:** Add the email addresses of the Google accounts that will authenticate (including your own).
4.  **Create OAuth Client ID:**
    * Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    * Click `+ Create Credentials` and select `OAuth client ID`.
    * For **Application type**, select `Web application`.
    * Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click `+ Add URI` and enter `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`.
    * Click `Create`.

5.  **Copy Your Credentials:**
    * A dialog will appear with **Your Client ID** and **Your Client Secret**.
    * Copy both values immediately.

    <WarningCallout title="Secure Your Credentials!">
    Your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` are sensitive. Store them securely in the SmythOS `Vault`. [Learn more here.](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)
    </WarningCallout>

### Step 2: Authenticate in SmythOS
1.  **Add a Firestore Component:** Drag any Firestore component onto your agent graph in SmythOS.
2.  **Enter Credentials:**
    * Click the component to open its **Settings**.
    * Input the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you just copied (or reference them from the Vault).
3.  **Authorize the Connection:**

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always store your Google Cloud `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use Firestore Security Rules:** This integration operates with the broad permissions granted via OAuth. It is critical to configure Firestore Security Rules in your Firebase project to define what data can be accessed and modified, providing a crucial layer of server-side protection.
* **Understand Data Structure:** Firestore is a NoSQL database. Plan your data structure with collections and documents in mind. A common pattern is to use the User ID (UID) from Firebase Authentication as the `document_id` for user-specific data.
* **Parse the `fields` Object:** When you get a document, the `fields` output contains nested objects with data types (e.g., `{"name": {"stringValue": "Jane"}}`). You will need to use a Code component or other tools to parse this structure to access the simple values (e.g., "Jane").

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Authentication Errors (`invalid_client`, `redirect_uri_mismatch`):**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `Client ID`/`Secret` or a misconfigured redirect URI.
    * **Solution:** Verify your credentials. Ensure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console is exactly `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden` / PERMISSION_DENIED**
    * **Cause:** The authenticated user does not have permission to access Firestore in the specified project, or the Firestore API is not enabled.
    * **Solution:** Ensure the **Cloud Firestore API** is enabled in your GCP project. Confirm the authenticating user has a role with Firestore permissions, such as "Cloud Datastore User."

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `document_id` or `collection_id` specified does not exist when trying to `Get` or `Delete` a document.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the path to your document is correct. Check for typos in the IDs.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / Invalid Argument**
  * **Cause:** The JSON `Body` for creating or updating a document is malformed.
  * **Solution:** Ensure your fields follow the correct Firestore REST API structure: `{"fields": {"yourFieldName": {"stringValue": "yourValue"}}}`. Every value must be wrapped in an object that declares its type.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful, data-driven applications with the **SmythOS Firestore Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a full backend for a user registration system. It uses the [Firebase Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firebase-integration) to create a user, then uses the Firestore `Create Document` component to save their profile information, using their new Firebase UID as the document ID.
    * Powers a configuration panel. An agent fetches settings from a "config" collection in Firestore using `Get Document` to dynamically change its own behavior without needing to be redeployed.
    * Creates a logging system. After performing any critical action (like sending an important email), an agent uses `Create Document` to write a log entry with a timestamp and details to a "logs" collection in Firestore.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Connect a [web scraper](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/scrapingbee-integration) to your agent. Scrape data from websites and use `Create Document` to save the structured data directly into Firestore.
    * Use Firestore as a state machine. An agent can read the status of a long-running job from a document, perform the next step, and then use `Update Document` to update the status.
