  <summary>Why Integrate Firebase with Your Agent?</summary>

Firebase provides a complete suite of tools for building applications, with Firebase Authentication being a cornerstone service. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build agents that can manage your app's user base.

- **Automate User Onboarding:** Create agents that handle the entire sign-up process. When a new user fills out a form, an agent can automatically create their account in Firebase.
- **Backend for Frontend Operations:** Build agents that act as a secure backend for your frontend application. An agent can take user credentials, sign them in using Firebase, and then perform actions on their behalf.
- **Personalized Experiences:** Use agents to fetch data for a logged-in user to provide a personalized experience. For example, an agent could retrieve a user's name and past orders to customize a conversation.
- **Streamline User Management:** Automate administrative tasks like updating user passwords or emails (by combining these components with other Firebase REST API calls in a generic API component).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Google Firebase Project**.
- **Email/Password Sign-In** enabled in your Firebase Authentication settings.
- Your Firebase project's **Web API Key**.

## Getting Started With Firebase

The connection between SmythOS and Firebase Authentication is configured using your project's Web API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Firebase Web API Key
1.  Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and select your project.
2.  In the project sidebar, click the **Settings gear** and select **Project settings**.
3.  Under the **General** tab, scroll down to the "Your apps" card.
4.  If you don't have a web app, create one by clicking the `</>` icon.
5.  In your web app's configuration details, you will find the `apiKey`. Copy this value.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Firebase Web API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `firebase_web_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Firebase Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Firebase component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `firebase_web_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Firebase component you use. This key identifies your Firebase project for each request.</InfoCallout>

## Which Firebase Component Should I Use?

| If you need toâ€¦ | Workflow | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Register a new user** for your app | User Sign-up | [Create User](#create-user) | This is the dedicated endpoint for creating a new account with email and password. |
| **Log an existing user in** | User Sign-in | [Sign In With Email & Password](#sign-in-with-email--password) | This component authenticates a user's credentials and returns a session `idToken`. |
| **Get details for the current user** (e.g., after they log in) | Fetching Profile | [Get User Data](#get-user-data) | This takes the `idToken` from a sign-in event to securely retrieve that user's information. |

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each Firebase component.

### <a name="create-user"></a>Create User
Creates a new user account in your Firebase project using an email and password.

<InfoCallout>This component requires a `Web API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-firebase) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `email` | string | Yes | The user's email address. Must be a valid email format. |
| `password` | string | Yes | The user's password. Must be at least six characters long. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `idToken` | string | A Firebase ID token for the newly created user's session. |
| `localId` | string | The unique user ID (UID) assigned to the new user. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Firebase Auth API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
An agent powers a "Sign Up" form. It takes the submitted email and password, passes them to this component, and upon success, uses the `localId` to create a corresponding user profile in a separate database.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "firebase.createUser",
  "email": "new.user@example.com",
  "password": "strongPassword123"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Security">
Always handle passwords securely. This component should be called from a trusted server-side environment like a SmythOS agent, not directly from a client-side browser where the password could be intercepted.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="sign-in-with-email--password"></a>Sign In With Email & Password
Signs in an existing user with their email and password and returns an ID token for their session. (Formerly "ID Token").

<InfoCallout>This component requires a `Web API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-firebase) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `email` | string | Yes | The email address of the existing user. |
| `password` | string | Yes | The password for the user's account. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `idToken` | string | A Firebase ID token for the authenticated user's session. This is required for other authenticated requests. |
| `localId` | string | The unique user ID (UID) of the signed-in user. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Firebase Auth API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
This component is the core of a login workflow. After a user signs in, the agent receives the `idToken` and passes it to the "Get User Data" component to fetch their profile and personalize the app experience.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "firebase.idToken",
  "email": "existing.user@example.com",
  "password": "userPassword123"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Token Expiration">
The `idToken` returned by this component is short-lived (typically one hour). For long sessions, you will need to use the `refreshToken` (found in the raw `Response`) to get a new ID token.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="get-user-data"></a>Get User Data
Retrieves the profile information for an authenticated user, using their session ID token.

<InfoCallout>This component requires a `Web API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-firebase) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `idToken` | string | Yes | The Firebase ID token obtained from a successful sign-in. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `users` | array | An array containing a single user object with their profile information (UID, email, creation date, etc.). |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Firebase Auth API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
After a user logs in successfully using the "Sign In" component, the agent immediately calls this component with the resulting `idToken` to retrieve the user's display name and greet them personally.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "firebase.getUserData",
  "idToken": "id-token-from-previous-step"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Authentication Required">
This component will fail if the `idToken` is missing, invalid, or expired. It is a secure way to fetch data only for the currently authenticated user.
</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Firebase Web API key in the SmythOS `Vault`. While it is a public key, keeping it in the Vault makes management easier.
* **Understand the Auth Flow:** The typical flow is `Create User` for new users, followed by `Sign In` to get an `idToken`, and then `Get User Data` using that token. For returning users, the flow starts with `Sign In`.
* **Handle Tokens Securely:** The `idToken` proves a user is signed in. Never expose it to untrusted environments. It should be managed within your agent's workflow to make secure requests.
* **Use Firebase Security Rules:** While this integration manages users, remember to configure Firebase Security Rules for services like Firestore and Cloud Storage to control what data each authenticated user can access.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `EMAIL_EXISTS`**
  * **Cause:** Attempting to create a user with an email address that is already registered in your Firebase project.
  * **Solution:** This is expected behavior. Your agent's logic should handle this by informing the user that the email is already in use, perhaps suggesting they sign in instead.

* **Error: `INVALID_PASSWORD` or `EMAIL_NOT_FOUND`**
  * **Cause:** The email/password combination provided to the "Sign In" component is incorrect.
  * **Solution:** This is a standard failed login attempt. Your agent should return a generic "Invalid credentials" message to the user.

* **Error: `TOKEN_EXPIRED`**
  * **Cause:** The `idToken` used in the "Get User Data" component has expired (they typically last for one hour).
  * **Solution:** Your application needs a mechanism to refresh the ID token using the refresh token provided upon sign-in. This is a more advanced flow that may require calling the Firebase token refresh endpoint.

* **Error: `API_KEY_NOT_VALID`**
  * **Cause:** The Web API Key configured in the component's settings is incorrect.
  * **Solution:** Go to your Firebase Project Settings, copy the correct `apiKey`, and update the secret in your SmythOS Vault.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build applications with secure user management using the **SmythOS Firebase Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Manages a complete user lifecycle. A user signs up via a form, the agent calls `Create User`, then logs the new `localId` into a separate database (like Firestore or a SQL database) to store additional profile information.
    * Acts as a backend for a simple web app. The frontend collects login details, sends them to the agent, which uses `Sign In` to authenticate, and then uses the `idToken` to securely fetch and return user-specific data.
    * Connects to other services. After a user signs up with Firebase, the agent could also create a corresponding customer profile in a CRM like HubSpot.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Firebase Auth with a database integration like [Firestore (via the OpenAPI component)](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openapi-integration) or a SQL database to store and retrieve data associated with a user's `localId`.
    * After a new user is created, trigger a welcome [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration) to be sent to their registered email address.
