## Getting Started With Hugging Face

The connection between SmythOS and Hugging Face is configured using a secure Access Token.

### Step 1: Get Your Hugging Face Access Token
1.  Log in to your [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/).
2.  Navigate to your profile settings by clicking your profile picture in the top-right corner.
3.  In the left menu, click on **Access Tokens**.
4.  Click the **New token** button. Give your token a name and a role (e.g., `read`).
5.  Copy the generated token to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your Access Token in SmythOS Vault
Your Access Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Hugging Face Access Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `huggingface_access_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure the Hugging Face Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Hugging Face** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Access Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `huggingface_access_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Access Token from the Vault to each Hugging Face component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the main Hugging Face component.

### <a name="inference-api-runner"></a>Inference API Runner
Runs inference on any publicly available model on the Hugging Face Hub using their serverless Inference API.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `Access Token` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-hugging-face) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `model` | string | Yes | The ID of the model from the Hugging Face Hub (e.g., `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`). |
| `inputs`| any | Yes | The input data for the model. The format depends entirely on the model being used. It could be a string, an object with parameters, or a URL to an image/audio file. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `response`| any | The raw output from the model. The structure of this output varies greatly between models. |
| `headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case: Sentiment Analysis" collapsible>
An agent takes customer feedback text from a form, passes it as the `inputs` to the `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model, and then checks the `response` to see if the sentiment is `POSITIVE` or `NEGATIVE`.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "huggingface.inference",
  "model": "distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english",
  "inputs": "SmythOS is an amazing platform that has streamlined our workflows!"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Check Model Documentation!">
The single most important step is to **check the documentation on the model's page on the Hugging Face Hub**. This will tell you the exact format required for the `inputs` and what structure to expect in the `response`.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Access Token:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your Hugging Face Access Token.
* **Start with Popular Models:** When exploring a new task, start with the most popular and well-documented models on the Hub. They are often more reliable and have more examples.
* **Parse the Response Carefully:** The output structure is model-specific. Use a "Code" component in SmythOS to parse the JSON `response` and extract the exact fields you need for downstream steps.
* **Handle Model Loading Times:** The first time you call a model via the Inference API, it may need to be loaded into memory, which can take some time. Subsequent calls are usually much faster. Build appropriate delays or retries into your agent if you need an immediate response.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Access Token is missing, invalid, or does not have the correct permissions.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the Access Token in your SmythOS Vault is correct. Ensure you are using a token with at least `read` permissions.

* **Error: `503 Service Unavailable` or "Model is loading"**
  * **Cause:** The model you are trying to use is currently being loaded onto a server. This is common on the first request.
  * **Solution:** Wait a minute and try the request again. You can build a loop with a delay in your agent to handle this automatically.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` or Model-Specific Validation Error**
  * **Cause:** The `inputs` you provided are not in the format the model expects.
  * **Solution:** Go to the model's page on the Huggng Face Hub. Read its documentation carefully and look at the examples to see the required input structure. For example, some models expect `{"inputs": "your text"}` while others might expect `{"text": "your text"}`.
