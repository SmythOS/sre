  <summary>Why Integrate HubSpot with Your Agent?</summary>

HubSpot is a central CRM for managing the entire customer lifecycle. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that connect your sales, marketing, and service operations to all your other systems.

- **Automate Lead Management:** Create agents that capture leads from website forms, social media, or other channels and automatically create new contact and deal records in HubSpot.
- **Streamline Sales Processes:** Build an agent that, when a deal is moved to a new stage in HubSpot, automatically sends a follow-up email, schedules a meeting, and creates a task for the sales representative.
- **Enhance Customer Service:** When a customer submits a support request via email or chat, an agent can automatically create a new ticket in the HubSpot Service Hub, assign it to the right team, and send an automated confirmation to the customer.
- **Data Synchronization:** Keep your HubSpot data in sync with other platforms. An agent can update contact properties in HubSpot when they change in your e-commerce platform or billing system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **HubSpot account** with permissions to create private apps.
- A HubSpot Private App **Access Token**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With HubSpot

The connection between SmythOS and HubSpot is configured using a secure Access Token from a private app.

### Step 1: Get Your HubSpot Access Token
1.  Log in to your [HubSpot account](https://app.hubspot.com/).
2.  Navigate to **Settings** (the gear icon in the top navigation).
3.  In the left menu, go to **Integrations** > **Private Apps**.
4.  Click **Create a private app**.
5.  On the **Basic Info** tab, give your app a name (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and description.
6.  Go to the **Scopes** tab and grant the necessary permissions. For full functionality, you may need scopes like `crm.objects.contacts.write`, `crm.objects.deals.read`, `tickets`, etc.
7.  Click **Create app**. A dialog will appear with your **Access Token**.
8.  **Copy this token immediately.** It will not be shown again.

### Step 2: Store Your Access Token in SmythOS Vault
Your Access Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your HubSpot Access Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `hubspot_access_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a HubSpot Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any HubSpot component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `HubSpot Access Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Access Token from the Vault to **each** HubSpot component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Access Token:** Your HubSpot Access Token grants broad access to your CRM data. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use Minimal Scopes:** When creating your private app in HubSpot, grant only the permissions your agent needs. If it only manages contacts, it doesn't need access to deals or tickets.
* **Handle Pagination:** For all `List` components, the API returns paginated results. To get all records, you must build a loop that uses the corresponding `Next ... Page` component, passing the `pagingNextAfter` token from the previous call until it is no longer returned.
* **Understand the HubSpot Object Model:** To associate objects (e.g., linking a deal to a contact), you will typically need to create or get one object first to retrieve its ID, then use that ID when creating the second object. This may require advanced use of the component's `Body` setting if not available as a direct input.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Access Token is incorrect, has been revoked, or is missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the Access Token in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Generate a new token in your HubSpot private app settings if necessary.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The private app's Access Token does not have the required scopes for the action you are trying to perform (e.g., trying to create a contact without `crm.objects.contacts.write` scope).
  * **Solution:** Go to your private app's settings in HubSpot, navigate to the **Scopes** tab, and ensure all necessary permissions are checked.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect ID was provided (e.g., `contactId`, `deal_id`).
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Use a `List` or `Search` component to verify that the resource you are trying to access exists.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful sales, marketing, and service automations with the **SmythOS HubSpot Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Manages the entire lead lifecycle. It captures a lead from a form, creates a `Contact` in HubSpot, creates a `Deal`, and then assigns a `Task` to a sales rep to follow up.
    * Syncs data from your e-commerce platform. When a new customer makes a purchase on [Shopify](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/shopify-integration), the agent finds or creates a `Contact` in HubSpot and updates a custom property with their total order value.
    * Automates support. It receives an email, uses an [LLM](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to determine if it's a bug report, and if so, creates a new `Ticket` in the Service Hub.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a new contact is created, trigger a workflow to add them to a specific marketing list in [Mailchimp](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/mailchimp-integration) or [Klaviyo](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/klaviyo-integration).
    * When a deal is marked "Closed-Won," trigger an agent to create a new client record in your accounting software and a new project in [Asana](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/asana-integration).
    * Use the [Twilio Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/twilio-integration) to send an SMS notification to a sales rep when a high-priority deal is created for them.
