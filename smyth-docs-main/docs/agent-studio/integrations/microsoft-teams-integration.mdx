  <summary>Why Integrate Microsoft Teams with Your Agent?</summary>

Microsoft Teams is the central nervous system for many organizations. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful automations that live where your team works.

- **Automated Alerts & Notifications:** Create agents that monitor your infrastructure, applications, or other services and post real-time alerts to a specific Teams channel, ensuring rapid response.
- **Streamline Business Processes:** Use agents to bridge the gap between systems. For example, when a new high-priority ticket is created in your support system, an agent can automatically create a new chat with the on-call engineers.
- **Interactive Agents:** Build agents that can receive commands or data from Teams messages (requires a webhook setup), process the information, and post a result back into the chat.
- **Centralized Reporting:** Schedule agents to gather data from various sources (e.g., Google Analytics, GitHub, databases) and post a daily or weekly summary report directly into a team's channel.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Microsoft 365 Account** with administrative permissions to register applications in Microsoft Entra.
- Your application's **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Microsoft Entra portal.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Microsoft Teams

The connection is handled via OAuth 2.0, which requires you to register an application in Microsoft Entra to get your credentials. This is a one-time setup.

### Step 1: Register an Application in Microsoft Entra
1.  Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2.  Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** and click **+ New registration**.
3.  **Configure your application:**
    * **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "SmythOS Teams Integration").
    * **Supported account types:** Choose the option that best fits your organization's needs.
    * **Redirect URI:** Select **Web** and enter `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback`.
4.  Click **Register**.

### Step 2: Get Client ID and Client Secret
1.  **Client ID:** From your app's **Overview** page, copy the **Application (client) ID**.
2.  **Client Secret:**
    * Navigate to **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets**.
    * Click **+ New client secret**, add a description, and choose an expiration period.
    * Click **Add**. **Immediately copy the `Value` of the secret.** It will not be shown again.

### Step 3: Configure API Permissions
1.  In your app registration, go to the **API permissions** page.
2.  Click **+ Add a permission**, select **Microsoft Graph**, and choose **Delegated permissions**.
3.  Add the necessary permissions. Common permissions for these components include:
    * `Chat.Read`, `Chat.ReadWrite`
    * `ChannelMessage.Send`
    * `Team.ReadBasic.All`
    * `offline_access` (essential for long-running automations)
4.  After adding permissions, click the **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]** button.

### Step 4: Configure and Authenticate in SmythOS
1.  **Store Credentials:** Add your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to the SmythOS **Vault** for security.
2.  **Add a Component:** Drag any Microsoft Teams component onto your agent graph.
3.  **Authenticate:** Open the component's **Settings**, select your credentials from the Vault, and click the **Authenticate** button. You will be redirected to Microsoft to sign in and grant consent.

<InfoCallout title="OAuth and Permissions">
This OAuth 2.0 flow securely connects your Microsoft account. If you encounter permission errors later, ensure you have granted the correct API permissions in Microsoft Entra and provided admin consent.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always store your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand Permissions:** The Microsoft Graph API has a granular permission model. Ensure your Entra App Registration has been granted the correct delegated scopes (e.g., `Chat.ReadWrite`, `ChannelMessage.Send`) for the actions you want to perform.
* **Get User, Team, and Channel IDs:** You'll need the unique IDs for users, teams, and channels to use these components. These can be found in the Teams client (by creating links) or retrieved programmatically with other Graph API calls.
* **Use HTML for Rich Content:** The `content` field for sending messages supports HTML. Use this to format your messages with bold text, lists, and links for better readability.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The `Client ID` or `Client Secret` is incorrect, or the user's access token is invalid or expired.
  * **Solution:** Verify the credentials in your Vault. You may need to use the `Sign Out` and `Authenticate` buttons on the component settings to refresh your token.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** The application does not have the required API permissions (scopes) granted in Microsoft Entra for the action you are trying to perform.
  * **Solution:** Go to your App Registration in the Entra portal, navigate to **API permissions**, and ensure the necessary permissions (e.g., `ChannelMessage.Send`, `Chat.Create`) are added and have been granted admin consent.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect ID (`team_id`, `channel_id`, `chat_id`, `message_id`) was provided.
  * **Solution:** Double-check that the ID is correct and that the authenticated user has access to that resource.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful communication and collaboration workflows with the **SmythOS Microsoft Teams Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Monitors your GitHub repository. When a new pull request is opened, it posts a notification with a link to the PR in the relevant engineering channel.
    * Connects to your calendar. 10 minutes before a meeting, it sends a message to a group chat with all attendees, reminding them of the meeting and providing the agenda.
    * Gathers daily sales data from your CRM and posts a morning summary report to the `#sales-team` channel.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Teams with the [tl;dv Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/tldv-integration). After a meeting, an agent can fetch the summary and post it as a reply in the original meeting's chat thread.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to summarize a long email, then post the summary to a Teams channel for quick review.
    * When a new file is uploaded to [OneDrive](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/onedrive-integration), post a notification message with a link to the file in the appropriate team channel.
