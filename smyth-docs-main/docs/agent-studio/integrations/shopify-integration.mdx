  <summary>Why Integrate Shopify with Your Agent?</summary>

Your Shopify store is more than just products; it's a content platform. Integrating its content management features with SmythOS allows you to build powerful automation pipelines.

- **Automated Content Creation:** Create agents that take content from any source—a Google Doc, a Notion page, or an AI model's output—and automatically create and format new blog posts in your Shopify store.
- **Content Syndication:** Build a workflow that monitors your primary blog's RSS feed. When a new post is published, an agent can automatically re-publish it to your Shopify blog to drive engagement and SEO.
- **Dynamic Content Updates:** Connect your Shopify blog to other data sources. An agent could update an article with real-time information, event details, or related product links automatically.
- **Streamline Your Editorial Process:** Use agents to manage your content lifecycle. An agent can create a draft post, notify an editor in Slack for review, and once approved, another agent could potentially update the post to be published.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Shopify account** and store.
- Permissions to create and manage **private apps** in your Shopify admin panel.
- Your Shopify **Admin API access token**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Shopify

The connection between SmythOS and Shopify is configured using an Admin API access token generated from a private app.

### Step 1: Get Your Shopify API Access Token
1.  **Log in to your Shopify Admin Panel.**
2.  Navigate to **Apps** from the left-hand menu.
3.  Click on **Apps and sales channel settings**.
4.  Click **Develop apps**. If this is your first time, you may need to allow custom app development.
5.  Click **Create an app**. Give it a name (e.g., "SmythOS Content Agent") and select an App developer.
6.  Once the app is created, go to the **API credentials** tab. Click **Configure Admin API scopes**.
7.  Grant the necessary permissions. For content management, you will need at least `read_blogs` and `write_blogs`.
8.  Click **Save**, then click **Install app** in the top right.
9.  After installing, the **Admin API access token** will be revealed. **Copy this token immediately.** It will not be shown again.

### Step 2: Store Your Access Token in SmythOS Vault
Your Admin API access token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Shopify Admin API access token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `shopify_admin_api_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a Shopify Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Shopify component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Access Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `shopify_admin_api_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Access Token from the Vault to **each** Shopify component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

| **Save an article for later review** | A `blog_id`, `title`, `content` | [Create Draft Article](#create-draft-article) | Creates the article but keeps it hidden from your live site until you publish it. |

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Access Token:** Your Shopify Admin API access token grants significant permissions to your store. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand the Hierarchy:** To post an article, you first need to know which `blog_id` to post it to. Use the `Get Blogs` component to find the correct ID for your "News" or "Updates" blog.
* **Use HTML for Content:** The `body_html` input requires your content to be in HTML format. Your agent should be designed to generate or convert content to HTML before passing it to the component.
* **Manage Scopes:** When creating your private app in Shopify, grant only the permissions your agent needs. If it only manages blogs, it doesn't need access to `read_orders` or `write_products`.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Admin API access token is incorrect, has been uninstalled, or is missing the required scopes.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the token in your SmythOS Vault is correct. In your Shopify admin panel, ensure the private app is still installed and that you have granted the necessary scopes (e.g., `write_blogs`).

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `store_name`, `blog_id`, or `article_id` is incorrect.
  * **Solution:** Double-check your store name (it should be the `your-store.myshopify.com` domain). Use `Get Blogs` and `List Articles` to verify your IDs are correct.

* **Error: `422 Unprocessable Entity`**
  * **Cause:** The request body is malformed. This typically means a required field like `title` or `body_html` is missing when creating an article.
  * **Solution:** Check that all required inputs are provided and correctly formatted. Ensure the `body_html` contains valid HTML.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful content automations for your Shopify store with the **SmythOS Shopify Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a content syndication engine. It monitors your primary company blog, and when a new post is published, it automatically creates a corresponding article on your Shopify blog to drive traffic.
    * Generates product-related content. When you add a new product to your store, an agent uses an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to write a "Product Spotlight" article and saves it as a draft for your review.
    * Connects your content and social media. After an agent creates a new article, it takes the article's URL and shares it across your social channels using the [Ayrshare Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration).

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use a [Webflow](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/webflow-integration) or [WordPress.org](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/wordpress-org-integration) integration to pull content from another CMS and sync it with your Shopify blog.
    * Keep a log of all articles published by your agents in a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for content tracking and performance analysis.
