  <summary>Why Integrate Dev.to with Your Agent?</summary>

Dev.to is a massive community for developers. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to programmatically manage your content and engage with the community more efficiently.

- **Automate Content Syndication:** Create an agent that monitors your personal blog's RSS feed. When a new post is published, the agent can automatically re-publish it to your Dev.to account to reach a wider audience.
- **Streamline Your Writing Workflow:** Build an agent that takes a Markdown file from a GitHub repository, adds the necessary frontmatter (like title and tags), and saves it as a draft on Dev.to, ready for your final review.
- **Content Generation Pipelines:** Use an AI model to generate a technical article or tutorial. An agent can then take this generated content and directly create a draft in your Dev.to account.
- **Backup and Archiving:** While not a primary use case for these components, you could build agents to fetch your existing articles (using a custom API component) and back them up elsewhere.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Dev.to account**.
- Your Dev.to **API Key**.

## Getting Started With Dev.to

The connection between SmythOS and Dev.to is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Dev.to API Key
1.  Log in to your [Dev.to account](https://dev.to/).
2.  Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and go to **Settings**.
3.  In the left menu, navigate to **Account** > **API Keys**. The direct link is `https://dev.to/settings/extensions`.
4.  In the "Forem API Keys" section, give your key a description (e.g., "SmythOS Agent") and click **Generate API Key**.
5.  Copy the generated key to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Dev.to API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `devto_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a Dev.to Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Dev.to component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `devto_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to each Dev.to component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Dev.to Component Should I Use?

| If you need toâ€¦ | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Immediately publish** an article for everyone to see | A complete article | [Publish Blog](#publish-blog) | This component makes the article live on the Dev.to platform as soon as it's executed. |
| **Save an article for later editing** and publishing | An incomplete or final draft | [Create Draft](#create-draft) | This allows you to programmatically get content into Dev.to without making it public immediately. |

This section provides detailed information for each Dev.to component.

### <a name="publish-blog"></a>Publish Blog
Publishes an article directly to the Dev.to platform, making it live and visible to the community.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-devto) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Yes | The title of the article. |
| `body` | string | Yes | The main content of the article, written in Markdown. |

| `articleUrl`| string | The direct URL to the live article on Dev.to. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Dev.to API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
An agent takes the final, approved version of a blog post from a Notion database and uses this component to publish it directly to Dev.to, cross-posting it for a wider audience.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "devto.publishBlog",
  "title": "A Guide to Building AI Agents",
  "body": "## Introduction\\n\\nBuilding AI agents is easier than ever...",
  "description": "Learn the fundamentals of creating powerful AI agents with this step-by-step guide.",
  "tags": ["ai", "development", "tutorial"]
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Immediate Publication">
This action is immediate. As soon as the component runs successfully, your article will be live on Dev.to. For a staged approach, use the "Create Draft" component first.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="create-draft"></a>Create Draft
Saves an article as a private draft in your Dev.to account. It will not be visible to the public until you manually publish it.

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
An agent generates a first draft of a technical tutorial using an AI model. It then saves this content to Dev.to as a draft, allowing a human editor to review, refine, and manually publish it later.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "devto.createDraft",
  "title": "DRAFT: Understanding Serverless Computing",
  "body": "Serverless computing is a cloud execution model...",
  "description": "A draft exploring the pros and cons of serverless.",
  "tags": ["serverless", "cloud", "architecture"]
}
```

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Dev.to API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use Markdown:** The `body` input for both components uses Markdown. Your agent can be designed to generate or format content into Markdown before passing it to the component.
* **Frontmatter:** The Dev.to API uses a JSON payload. However, if you were to structure your `body` input with YAML frontmatter (the metadata at the top of a Markdown file), the API can often parse it to set the title, tags, and other properties, which can be an alternative way to structure your input.
* **Update Articles:** To update an existing article, you would need to use a `PUT` request to the `/api/articles/{id}` endpoint. This would require a custom API call component in SmythOS where you provide the `articleId` obtained from creating the article.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, has been revoked, or is missing from the request header.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Ensure it is correctly selected in the component settings.

* **Error: `422 Unprocessable Entity`**
  * **Cause:** The request body is malformed. This typically means the `title` or `body` is missing, or the `tags` are not in the correct format (e.g., not an array of strings).
  * **Solution:** Check that all required inputs are provided and correctly formatted. Ensure the `body` contains valid Markdown.

* **Article Appears with "Invalid User"**
  * **Cause:** This can sometimes happen if the API key is invalid or has issues.
  * **Solution:** Regenerate your API key on Dev.to and update the secret in your SmythOS Vault.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful content automation pipelines with the **SmythOS Dev.to Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Connects to your [GitHub](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/github-integration) repository. When you merge a new Markdown file into your `blog` folder, the agent automatically takes the content and creates a draft on Dev.to.
    * Generates a weekly "Top 5 AI News" summary using an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) and a [search tool](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/tavily-integration), then publishes the summary as a blog post.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * After an agent publishes a new article using `Publish Blog`, it can take the `articleUrl` and share it across all your social channels using the [Ayrshare Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration).
    * Keep a log of all published articles by having your agent write the `articleId` and `articleUrl` to a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration).
