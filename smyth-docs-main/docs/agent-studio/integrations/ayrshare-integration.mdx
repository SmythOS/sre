  <summary>Why Integrate Ayrshare with Your Agent?</summary>

Ayrshare is a powerful API for social media management. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build sophisticated content distribution and social media monitoring agents.

- **Automate Content Calendars:** Create an agent that reads from a Google Sheet or Notion database and automatically schedules and publishes social media posts according to your content calendar.
- **Cross-Platform Distribution:** Publish content everywhere at once. An agent can take a single blog post summary and post it to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook simultaneously.
- **Content Curation and Sharing:** Build an agent that monitors RSS feeds for interesting articles. When a new article is found, the agent can summarize it with an LLM and share the link and summary to your social channels.
- **Data-Driven Social Media:** Connect your analytics or business intelligence tools to SmythOS. When a key milestone is reached (e.g., a new sales record), an agent can automatically generate and post a celebratory message.

## Prerequisites

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Ayrshare

The connection between SmythOS and Ayrshare is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Ayrshare API Key
1.  Log in to your [Ayrshare Dashboard](https://app.ayrshare.com/api).
2.  Your API Key is displayed on this page. Click to copy it.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Ayrshare API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `ayrshare_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure an Ayrshare Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Ayrshare component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Ayrshare API key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `ayrshare_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Ayrshare component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Ayrshare API Key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use a URL Shortener:** While Ayrshare shortens URLs, for advanced tracking and analytics, consider using a dedicated URL shortener service first and including the shortened link in your `post` text.
* **Scheduling Posts:** To schedule a post for the future, include a `scheduleDate` parameter in the `Body` of your request. This is an advanced input you can add. The date should be in ISO 8601 format.
* **Check Post Status:** After sending a post, it's good practice to use the returned `id` with the `Get a Post` component after a short delay to confirm that it was published successfully on all platforms.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, invalid, or missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your Ayrshare dashboard.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request`**
  * **Cause:** A required input is missing (e.g., no `post` text), a `mediaUrls` link is invalid or not publicly accessible, or the post violates a platform's rules (e.g., text is too long for Twitter).
  * **Solution:** Check all inputs. Ensure media URLs are public and direct links to the media file. Check the `Response` object for a more detailed error message from Ayrshare.

* **Post Fails on One Platform but Not Others**
  * **Cause:** The social media account for that platform may have become disconnected, or the content violates a specific rule for that platform.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your Ayrshare dashboard to check the status of your linked social accounts. Re-link any that show an error. Adjust your content to meet the specific platform's guidelines.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build a powerful social media automation engine with the **SmythOS Ayrshare Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Creates a "content machine." It uses an AI model from [OpenRouter](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to write a short social media tip, generates a relevant background image with [Stability AI](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/stability-ai-integration), and posts the final image and text to Instagram and LinkedIn.
    * Monitors an RSS feed of your company's press releases. When a new one is published, it posts the title and a link to your corporate Twitter account.
    * Connects to your e-commerce platform. When a new 5-star product review is submitted, it formats the review into a nice graphic and posts it to Facebook.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use the [Google Sheets Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) to create a simple content calendar. Your agent can read rows from the sheet daily and post the content via Ayrshare.
    * Connect to [Ahrefs](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ahrefs-integration) or another SEO tool. When your website earns a new, high-quality backlink, post a "Thank You" message mentioning the linking site on Twitter.
