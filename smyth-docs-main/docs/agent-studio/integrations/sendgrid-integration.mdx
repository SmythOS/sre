  <summary>Why Integrate SendGrid with Your Agent?</summary>

SendGrid is a best-in-class email delivery platform. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build robust communication workflows and reliably deliver emails at scale.

- **Automate Transactional Emails:** Create agents that automatically send password resets, account verifications, order confirmations, and shipping notifications.
- **Personalized Marketing Campaigns:** Use agents to pull customer data from a CRM or database, and then send each customer a personalized promotional email using a dynamic SendGrid template.
- **Reliable Alerting System:** When an agent detects a critical system error or an important business event, it can use SendGrid to send a reliable email alert to the on-call team, ensuring deliverability.
- **Streamline Communication:** Centralize all your application's email-sending logic within SmythOS agents, making it easy to manage, update, and monitor your transactional email flows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **SendGrid account**.
- A SendGrid **API Key**.
- A **verified sender identity** (domain or email address) in your SendGrid account.

## Getting Started With SendGrid

The connection between SmythOS and SendGrid is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your SendGrid API Key
1.  Log in to your [SendGrid account](https://app.sendgrid.com/).
2.  Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in the left-hand menu.
3.  Click **Create API Key**.
4.  Give your key a name (e.g., "SmythOS Agent Key") and select **Full Access** or restricted permissions as needed. For sending email, `Mail Send` permissions are required.
5.  Click **Create & View**.
6.  **Copy the API key immediately.** It will not be shown again for security reasons.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your SendGrid API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `sendgrid_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure a SendGrid Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any SendGrid component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `sendgrid_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** SendGrid component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which SendGrid Component Should I Use?

| If you need toâ€¦ | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Send a beautifully designed, personalized email** (e.g., a receipt) | A `template_id` and dynamic data | [Send Dynamic Email](#send-dynamic-email) | Leverages powerful Handlebars templates for personalization and consistent branding. |
| **Send a quick, simple text notification** (e.g., a system alert) | `subject` and `content` text | [Send Static Email](#send-static-email) | The fastest way to send a basic email without needing to pre-configure a template. |

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each SendGrid component.

### <a name="send-dynamic-email"></a>Send Dynamic Email
Sends an email using a Dynamic Transactional Template from your SendGrid account, populated with data you provide.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-sendgrid) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `from` | string | Yes | The sender's email address. Must be a verified sender in SendGrid. |

| `Response`| object | A successful send returns an empty body with a `202 Accepted` status code. The response object will be empty on success. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response, useful for getting the `x-message-id`. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
An agent handles new user sign-ups. It calls this component with the user's name and a welcome `template_id` to send a personalized onboarding email.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "sendgrid.sendDynamicEmail",
  "from": "welcome@example.com",
  "to": "new.user@example.com",
  "template_id": "d-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",

    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "account_level": "Premium"
  }
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Template Data">
The keys in your `JSON_template_handlebars` object must match the Handlebars variables (e.g., `{{name}}`) in your SendGrid template exactly.

{
  "component": "sendgrid.sendStaticEmail",
  "from": "alerts@example.com",

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your SendGrid API key in the SmythOS `Vault`. If a key is ever compromised, be sure to revoke it in your SendGrid account immediately.
* **Use Dynamic Templates for Branding:** For any user-facing email, it's best practice to use the `Send Dynamic Email` component. This allows you to maintain consistent branding and easily update email designs in SendGrid without changing your agent's logic.
* **Verify Senders:** Before you can send an email from an address (or domain), you must prove you own it by completing the Sender Authentication process in your SendGrid account.
* **Monitor Your Email Activity:** Use the SendGrid dashboard to monitor your email deliverability, open rates, and click rates to ensure your emails are reaching the inbox and engaging users.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, has been revoked, or does not have the required `Mail Send` permissions.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active. Check its permissions in your SendGrid account settings.

* **Error: `403 Forbidden`**
  * **Cause:** A common cause is trying to send an email from an address that has not been verified as a Single Sender or part of an authenticated domain in your SendGrid account.
  * **Solution:** Go to your SendGrid settings and complete the Sender Authentication process for the `from` address.

* **Emails Go to Spam**
  * **Cause:** This is a complex deliverability issue often related to domain reputation, lack of proper authentication (like DKIM and SPF, which are part of Sender Authentication), or email content.
  * **Solution:** Ensure you have completed Sender Authentication in SendGrid. Avoid spammy-sounding subject lines and content.

* **Dynamic Template Data Not Appearing**
  * **Cause:** The keys in your `JSON_template_handlebars` input do not exactly match the variable names in your SendGrid template (e.g., `{{name}}` in the template vs. `"username"` in the JSON).
  * **Solution:** Carefully check that every key in your JSON payload matches the corresponding Handlebars variable in the template.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful email automation workflows with the **SmythOS SendGrid Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Manages a newsletter. The agent reads a list of subscribers from a database, fetches the latest blog post content, and sends a personalized weekly newsletter using a dynamic template.
    * Powers a password reset flow. When a user requests a reset, the agent generates a unique, single-use link and sends it to them using a secure SendGrid template.
    * Connects to your e-commerce platform. When an order ships, the agent sends a dynamic "Your Order is on its Way!" email, populating the template with the customer's name, order number, and tracking link.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine SendGrid with the [Firebase Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/firebase-integration). When a new user is created in Firebase Auth, trigger an agent to send them a welcome email.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to generate a personalized sales outreach message, then send it via the `Send Static Email` component.
    * Fetch data from a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) to power a mail merge, sending a dynamic email to each person listed in the sheet.
