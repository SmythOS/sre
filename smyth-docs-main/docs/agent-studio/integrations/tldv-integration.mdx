  <summary>Why Integrate tl;dv with Your Agent?</summary>

tl;dv records, transcribes, and summarizes your meetings. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to turn those conversations into structured, actionable data for your automated workflows.

- **Automate Follow-ups:** Create agents that listen for action items in a meeting transcript, and then automatically create tasks in your project management tool.
- **Enhance CRM Data:** After a sales call, an agent can fetch the transcript, use an LLM to summarize the customer's needs, and append the summary to the contact's record in your CRM.
- **Streamline Research:** Automatically pull transcripts from all user research calls, feed them into an AI model to extract key themes and pain points, and generate a summary report.
- **Build a Knowledge Base:** Create a searchable database of your team's collective knowledge by having agents fetch and index the transcripts of all internal meetings.

## Prerequisites

- A **tl;dv account**.
- Your tl;dv **API Key**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With tl;dv

The connection between SmythOS and tl;dv is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your tl;dv API Key
1.  Log in to your [tl;dv account](https://tldv.io).
2.  Navigate to your account settings or profile.
3.  Find the **API Keys** section and generate a new API key.
4.  Copy the key to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your tl;dv API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `tldv_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a tl;dv Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any tl;dv component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `TLDV API key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `tldv_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** tl;dv component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your tl;dv API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Combine Components for Powerful Workflows:** The real power of this integration comes from chaining components. For example: `Get Meetings List` -> `Loop` -> `Get Transcript` -> `AI Summarizer`.
* **Parse Transcript Data:** The transcript data can be quite large. Use Code components or AI models to parse this text to find action items, key decisions, or customer feedback.
* **Handle Pagination:** When using `Get Meetings List`, be aware of the `limit` and `page` parameters. If you have more meetings than the limit, you will need to build a loop in your agent that increments the `page` input to fetch all results.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, invalid, or missing.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your tl;dv dashboard.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `meetingId` provided is incorrect or does not exist in your tl;dv account.
  * **Solution:** Double-check the `meetingId`. Ensure it was obtained from a valid source, like the `Get Meetings List` component.

* **Empty `data` or `results` Array**
  * **Cause:** The meeting may genuinely have no transcript or highlights, or the search/date range returned no meetings.
  * **Solution:** Verify in the tl;dv web application that the meeting has the data you expect. Broaden your search query or date range to test the connection.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful meeting intelligence workflows with the **SmythOS tl;dv Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Retrieves the transcripts of all sales calls from the past week, combines them, and asks an LLM to identify the most common customer objections and feature requests.
    * Monitors your calendar. After a meeting ends, it finds the corresponding tl;dv recording, fetches the transcript, identifies action items, and creates tasks in your project management tool.
    * Creates a "meeting summary" service. You send the agent a `meetingId`, and it returns a 3-bullet summary of the transcript and a list of the key highlights.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Feed transcripts from tl;dv into the [OpenAI Whisper](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/falai-integration) or other advanced speech models for further analysis or re-transcription if needed.
    * Log meeting summaries and action items into a [Notion](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/notion-integration) database or [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration).
    * Send automated meeting summary emails to all participants using the [Gmail](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-gmail-integration) integration.
