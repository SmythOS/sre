## Getting Started With Keywords Everywhere

The connection between SmythOS and Keywords Everywhere is configured using a secure API key.

### Step 1: Get Your Keywords Everywhere API Key
1.  Log in to your [Keywords Everywhere account](https://keywordseverywhere.com/).
2.  From the dashboard menu, navigate to the **API** section.
3.  Click the button to **Generate a new API key** (or copy your existing one).
4.  Copy the key to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Keywords Everywhere API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `keywords_everywhere_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 3: Configure the Keywords Everywhere Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Get Keyword Data** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `keywords_everywhere_api_key`).
4.  Optionally, select your preferred `Data Source`.
5.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to each Keywords Everywhere component you use. This ensures all connections are secure and properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the Keywords Everywhere component.

### <a name="get-keyword-data"></a>Get Keyword Data
Retrieves search volume, cost per click (CPC), and competition data for a list of keywords.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-keywords-everywhere) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Component-Specific Settings
In the component's settings panel, you can configure the `Data Source`:
- **`gpk` (Google Keyword Planner):** Fetches data directly from Google's Keyword Planner tool. This is the standard source for most SEO and PPC research.
- **`cli` (Clickstream Data):** Uses aggregated clickstream data to estimate metrics.

For most use cases, `gpk` is recommended.

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `keywords` | array | Yes | An array of strings, where each string is a keyword you want to analyze. |
| `country` | string | Optional | Two-letter country code to get localized data (e.g., `ca` for Canada). Default: `us`. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `data` | array | Parsed array of objects, where each object contains the metrics for a corresponding keyword. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Keywords Everywhere API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case" collapsible>
Create a content planning agent. Feed it a list of 20 blog post ideas (as keywords). The agent uses this component to fetch the search volume for each, then writes the keyword and its volume to a Google Sheet, sorted from highest to lowest volume, to help prioritize content creation.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "keywordsEverywhere.getKeywordData",
  "keywords": [
    "no-code automation",
    "how to build an agent",
    "SmythOS review"
  ],
  "country": "gb"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="API Credits">
Each keyword in the `keywords` array consumes one credit from your Keywords Everywhere account. Sending large arrays will consume credits quickly.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your Keywords Everywhere API key. Never expose it in plaintext.
* **Batch Your Keywords:** To work efficiently and minimize the number of API calls, group as many keywords as you need into a single request array rather than running the component multiple times in a loop.
* **Use the `country` Parameter:** For international SEO, always specify the target two-letter country code to get accurate, localized search volume and CPC data.
* **Monitor Your Credits:** Keep an eye on your credit balance in your Keywords Everywhere dashboard. Build alerts into your agents if you perform very high-volume analysis.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API key is invalid, has been disabled, or is missing from the request.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your Keywords Everywhere dashboard. Ensure the key is correctly selected in the component's settings.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** You have run out of API credits in your Keywords Everywhere account.
  * **Solution:** Log in to your Keywords Everywhere dashboard to check your credit balance and purchase more credits if necessary.

* **Empty `data` Array in Output**
  * **Cause:** The keywords submitted may not have any available data, or there could be a temporary issue with the API.
  * **Solution:** Check the keywords for typos. Test with a very common keyword (e.g., "google") to confirm the API connection is working. Examine the raw `Response` output for any specific error messages.

## What's Next?

You're now ready to build powerful SEO and content workflows with the **SmythOS Keywords Everywhere Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Takes a single seed keyword, uses another AI component to generate a list of 50 related long-tail keywords, and then feeds that list into this component to analyze their potential.
    * Monitors a competitor's sitemap, extracts new blog post URLs, guesses the target keyword, and then checks its search volume and competition level.
    * Creates a simple internal tool where your marketing team can input a list of keywords and have an agent return a downloadable CSV file (via Google Sheets) with all the metrics.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine keyword data with SERP data from the [DataForSEO Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/dataforseo-integration) to get a complete picture of the search landscape.
    * Use the metrics to inform content briefs generated by AI components.
    * Log historical keyword volume changes in the [Google Sheets Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) to track seasonality and trends.
