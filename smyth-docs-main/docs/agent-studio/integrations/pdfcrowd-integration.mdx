  <summary>Why Integrate PdfCrowd with Your Agent?</summary>

PdfCrowd is a robust API for handling document conversions. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that can create, process, and extract information from various document formats.

- **Automate Report Generation:** Create agents that gather data, render it into an HTML template, and then use the `HTML to PDF` component to generate a professional, shareable PDF report.
- **Content Archiving:** Build a workflow that takes a list of important URLs and automatically creates PDF snapshots of each page for a permanent, offline archive.
- **Data Extraction:** Use the `PDF to Text` component to extract text from invoices, contracts, or research papers. An agent can then parse this text to find key information, feed it into a database, or pass it to an LLM for analysis.
- **Streamline Document Workflows:** Automatically convert user-uploaded images into a standardized PDF format for consistent document management and storage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **PdfCrowd account**.
- Your PdfCrowd **Username** and **API Key**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With PdfCrowd

The connection between SmythOS and PdfCrowd is configured using your Username and API Key, which must be Base64 encoded.

### Step 1: Get Your PdfCrowd Credentials
1.  Sign up for a [PdfCrowd account](https://pdfcrowd.com/user/sign-up/).
2.  Your **Username** is the email you used to register.
3.  Navigate to your [Account page](https://pdfcrowd.com/user/account/change-api-key/) to find your **API Key**.

### Step 2: Base64 Encode Your Credentials
The API uses Basic Authentication. You need to combine your credentials and Base64 encode them.
1.  Combine your credentials into a single string with a colon in between: `YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_API_KEY`.
2.  Use a Base64 encoding tool (like the "Encode/Decode" component in SmythOS) to encode this entire string.
3.  Copy the resulting Base64 encoded string.

### Step 3: Store Your Encoded Key in SmythOS Vault
Your encoded key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.
1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your **Base64 encoded string** as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `pdfcrowd_base64_auth`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

### Step 4: Configure a PdfCrowd Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any PdfCrowd component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the authentication field (e.g., `Base64 Encoded Username and API Key`), select the secret you saved in the Vault.
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Base64 encoded secret from the Vault to **each** PdfCrowd component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Credentials:** Always store your Base64-encoded `username:api_key` string in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Use Public URLs:** All input URLs (`file_url`, `webpage/file_url`) must be publicly accessible over the internet for PdfCrowd's servers to be able to fetch them.
* **Handle Large Files:** Document conversion, especially for large or complex files, can take time. Design your agent workflows to account for potential delays.
* **Error Handling:** Check the `Headers` output for HTTP status codes. A `200 OK` indicates success, while codes like `400` or `500` indicate an error. The `Response` body will often contain a detailed error message.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Base64 encoded credentials are incorrect, or your PdfCrowd account has an issue (e.g., out of credits).
  * **Solution:** Carefully re-create and re-encode your `username:api_key` string. Log in to your PdfCrowd account to check your status and credit balance.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request`**
  * **Cause:** The input `file_url` is invalid, inaccessible, or points to an unsupported file type.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the URL is correct and publicly accessible. You can test this by trying to open the URL in an incognito browser window. Ensure the file format is supported by the specific conversion component.

* **Conversion Fails or Times Out**
  * **Cause:** The source file may be extremely large, complex, or corrupted. There could also be a temporary issue with the PdfCrowd service.
  * **Solution:** Try converting a smaller, simpler file to confirm your setup is correct. Check the PdfCrowd status page for any reported outages.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful document processing pipelines with the **SmythOS PdfCrowd Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a "Webpage Archiver." It takes a URL from a user, uses the `HTML to PDF` component to create a PDF snapshot, and then saves the file to [OneDrive](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/onedrive-integration).
    * Creates a "Report Summarizer." The agent receives a PDF report, uses `PDF to Text` to extract the content, and then feeds the text to an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to generate a concise summary.
    * Manages receipts. An agent takes user-submitted photos of receipts, uses the `Image to PDF` component to standardize them, and then stores them for expense reporting.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine PdfCrowd with a [web scraping tool](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/scrapingbee-integration). Scrape data from multiple pages, have your agent format it into a single HTML report, and then use `HTML to PDF` to create a final document.
    * After converting a document, use the [SendGrid Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/sendgrid-integration) to email the generated PDF or text file as an attachment.
