# Authentication Types

You can secure your agents and their integrations using multiple authentication methods in SmythOS. These help control access, protect sensitive data, and ensure authorized usage.

<InfoCallout title="Why it matters">
Use authentication to safeguard your agent workflows, API access, and user interactions. Always store secrets in the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) and configure token-based systems properly.

## Authentication Methods

Choose the right method based on your use case. All authentication types rely on the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) to securely store and inject credentials into workflows.

### API Key Authentication

Use for simple integrations with services that require static tokens.

1. Add your API key to the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)
2. Reference it inside your agent’s [API components](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/api-output)
3. SmythOS injects it automatically when the workflow runs

### OAuth Authentication

Use for secure, delegated user access via providers like Google, Microsoft, or custom IDPs.

1. Register your application with the identity provider  
2. Add the client ID and secret to the Vault  
3. Configure OAuth in your agent using the [Authentication Settings](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/authentication)

You’ll also need to define a secure callback URL. See the [OAuth setup guide](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/authentication) for required fields and structure.

### JWT Authentication

Use for stateless and secure token verification, often in internal systems.

1. Add your JWT secret or public key to the Vault  
2. Configure JWT logic in your agent  
3. Validate tokens passed with incoming requests

## Best Practices

- **Do not hardcode secrets** in your agent’s logic  
- **Use the Vault** for all credentials and keys  
- **Rotate keys regularly** to reduce security risk  
- **Minimize scope** when generating API keys or access tokens  
- **Audit logs** and monitor [agent logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) to detect misuse
