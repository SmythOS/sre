# Analytics

The **Analytics** dashboard helps you track how your agents are using compute. It gives you clarity on cost, efficiency, and overall performance.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Usage tracking keeps your budget clean. It helps you catch unexpected spikes, fine-tune your agent behavior, and make smarter decisions about where to deploy effort.
</InfoCallout>

## Dashboard Overview

At a glance, youâ€™ll see:

- **Total Model Usage (in USD)** for the selected timeframe  
- A **Daily Usage chart** that breaks down usage by task type

<SuccessCallout title="Real-time updates">
Analytics refresh automatically. You always get the latest numbers based on your filters.

## Filter by What Matters

Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow down results:

- **Space**: Filter by a specific team space or view all spaces
- **Agent**: Focus on a single agent or all agents
- **Date**: Pick a timeframe to review usage over time

<Image src="/docs/img/agent_collaboration/analytics-filtering.jpg" alt="Analytics Filters by Space, Agent, and Date" caption="Filter usage by space, agent, or month to get the most relevant view." />

<TipCallout title="Organise before you analyse">
Use clear space and agent naming in [Space Management](/docs/account-management/spaces-management) and [Organization Settings](/docs/account-management/organization-management). It makes filtering easier and your reports cleaner.

## Understanding the Usage Chart

Each bar represents a day. Each colour shows a type of compute used by your agents:

| Color | Category             |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| ðŸŸ¡ `#FACC15`          | Tasks                |
| ðŸŸ¢ `#22C55E`          | Weaver               |
| ðŸŸ¢ `#10B981`          | LLM                  |
| ðŸ”µ `#3B82F6`          | Tools                |
| ðŸ”´ `#EC4899`          | Code                 |
| ðŸŸ£ `#8B5CF6`          | Image Generation     |

<InfoCallout title="What counts as model usage?">
Any time your agent runs an LLM, tool, code block, or image generation, it contributes to model usage. Costs are based on the compute needed to complete those actions.

## Exporting Reports

Click **Export** to download your usage data as a `.csv`. It reflects the filters you've applied... perfect for billing, reports, or audits.

<SuccessCallout title="Pro tip: do this monthly">
Save a copy each month so you can compare usage trends or justify costs with stakeholders.

## How to Optimise

- Use filters to **identify high-cost agents**
- Look for **spikes in usage** and track what caused them
- Combine with [Work Schedules](/docs/agent-collaboration/agent-work-schedules) to reduce off-peak compute
- Review [Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) to make sure access matches role needs

<WarningCallout title="Zero usage for days?">
If an agent is deployed but not showing usage, check its triggers or schedule. It may not be running as expected.
</WarningCallout>

## FAQs

### How fresh is the data?

It updates in near real-time. Any new tasks, completions, or costs show up within moments of execution.

### What if usage seems high?

Use the filters to isolate the agent or space. Then:

- Review agent logs and schedules
- See if workflows are being retriggered too often
- Look for changes in task volume

You can also cap costs in your LLM provider settings.

### Can I see analytics across multiple orgs?

Not yet. Analytics works within the currently selected organization only. You can switch orgs in [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management).

### What if I want exact pricing details?

Head to [Model Rates](/docs/account-management/model-rates) to see a full cost breakdown by provider and action.

### Can Viewers access Analytics?

Only **Super Admins** and **Editors** can see the Analytics dashboard. [Check Roles](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) to confirm who can view what.
