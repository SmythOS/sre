# Chat with Agent

Use the **Chat** interface to talk directly to your deployed agent. You can type prompts, run actions, and test how it responds, without configuring endpoints or workflows.

<InfoCallout title="When to use chat">
Chat is the fastest way to test your agent’s intelligence, explore its skills, or assign quick tasks in real time.

This opens a dedicated full-screen chat panel where you can start interacting immediately.

## What You Can Do in Chat

Inside the chat panel, you can:

- Type instructions or questions (up to 8000 characters)
- Send prompts, commands, or structured JSON
- Upload files using the paperclip icon
- Read responses inline, without switching views
- Continue the thread as long as the session stays open
<WarningCallout title="Chat history isn't saved after closing">
Your session data is temporary. If you need to keep the outputs, copy them out before closing the panel.
</WarningCallout>

## Real-Time Execution

Every message you send is interpreted live using the agent’s current logic stack. This lets you:

- Try out phrasing and see how the agent reacts
- Refine prompts or input formats
- Run one-off tasks without building a full flow
<TipCallout title="Helpful for debugging">
If an agent isn’t behaving as expected, try breaking down your input in chat first. This often surfaces issues with prompt design or skill setup.
