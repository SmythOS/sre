# Spaces

A **Space** in SmythOS is a self-contained workspace where teams can manage their agents, data, workflows, and access independently. Spaces are ideal for separating clients, departments, environments, or use cases.

<InfoCallout title="Why use spaces?">
Spaces provide isolation. They keep agents, data, permissions, and branding scoped to a specific context, giving you clean separation across your workstreams.
</InfoCallout>

## Creating a space

To create a new space:

1. Click your [organization name](/docs/account-management/organization-management) in the top-right corner of the dashboard  
2. Select **Create New Space**
3. Enter a name for your space
4. (Optional) [Invite members](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/invite-members) and assign their [roles](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions)

|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Super Admin  | Full access to agents, vault, analytics, settings, roles, and members      |
| Admin        | Manage all space content and members, but not organization billing         |

<TipCallout title="Structure for clarity">
Use one space per client, product, or internal team. Keep sandbox/test spaces separate from live environments.
