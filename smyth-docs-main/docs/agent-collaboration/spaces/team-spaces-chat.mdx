# Team Spaces Chat

**Team Spaces Chat** lets anyone in your [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces) open a conversation with a deployed agent with no setup or special permissions. Everyone sees the same thread, enabling shared exploration and real-time collaboration.

<InfoCallout title="What is it?">
Team Chat is a shared interface between your agent and your teammates. It enables collective prompt testing, idea sharing, and iteration in one visible session.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Use Team Chat?

- Make agent development a collaborative activity  
- Onboard new team members without walkthroughs  
- Let non-technical teammates test prompts instantly  
- Accelerate prompt QA and idea testing

<TipCallout title="Fast Feedback">
Just open the space, click Chat, and you’re collaborating in seconds.
</TipCallout>

You’ll find Team Chat in the **Home** tab of your space:

1. Select a space from the top nav dropdown  
2. Go to the **Home** tab  
3. In the **Agents** section, find a deployed agent
