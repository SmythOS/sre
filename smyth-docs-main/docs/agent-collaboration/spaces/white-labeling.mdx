# White Labeling Your Agents

**White labeling** allows you to present your AI agents under your own brand. You can fully replace SmythOS visual elements across the agent UI, team spaces, subdomains, and email touchpoints, giving your clients and users a seamless, professional experience.

<InfoCallout title="Availability">
White labeling is available on the **Scaleup** plan and above.  
See [Plan Overview](/docs/account-management/overview) for feature availability.

## Why White Label?

A unified brand experience builds trust and signals professionalism. White labeling is useful when:

- **Working with clients:** Provide branded [spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/) where clients feel at home.
- **Embedding agents into your product:** Agents match your look and feel inside your platform.
- **Running internal tools:** Maintain brand consistency across internal-facing applications.
- **Reselling AI services:** Offer custom-branded experiences while using SmythOS infrastructure.

Custom branding helps reinforce your visual identity, even when powered by SmythOS.

## How to Set It Up

White labeling is applied at the **space level**, allowing different brands per workspace.

1. **Create a Space**  
   Navigate to [Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/) and create a dedicated space for your client or use case.

2. **Upload a Logo**  
   Inside the space, go to **Settings → Company Branding** and click **Change Logo**. Upload your image.

3. **Configure Domain**  
   Follow the steps in [Deploy to Your Domain](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-to-your-domain) to use your own subdomain via CNAME records.

4. **Deploy the Agent**  
   When deploying, select your verified domain. See [Agent Deployments Overview](/docs/agent-deployments/overview).

<WarningCallout title="Each space is branded independently">
Branding does not carry across spaces. Set it up separately for each workspace.
