# Invite Members

You can invite collaborators to your [**Space**](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/) in SmythOS to build, test, and manage agents as a team. Each member is assigned a role with permissions tailored to their responsibilities.

<InfoCallout title="Invite flow works per space">
Users must be invited into each space individually. To join a space, they must first be part of your [organization](/docs/account-management/organization-management).
</InfoCallout>
