# Agent Collaboration

SmythOS provides a full suite of tools for solo builders AND enterprise teams to help you build, share, and manage AI agents securely with your team, clients, and stakeholders.

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR">Use [Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/) to organize your projects, the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) to share secrets securely, and granular [Roles](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) to manage team access. </InfoCallout>

## Understanding Collaboration

Effective collaboration is key to scaling your automation efforts in [SmythOS](https://smythos.com):

-   **Organize Everything:** Keep projects for different clients or departments completely separate in isolated workspaces.
-   **Control Access:** Ensure team members and stakeholders can only see or edit what they're supposed to.
-   **Share Securely:** Distribute sensitive [API keys and credentials](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) without ever exposing the raw secret values.
-   **Work Together:** Enable multiple builders to work on agents in tandem and [manage workflows](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/building-workflows) without overriding each other's progress.

## Getting Started: A 3-Step Guide for Teams

Setting up your team for collaboration is simple. This journey ensures your workspace is organized and secure from day one.

1.  **Create a Space**
    Every collaborative project starts within a [Space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/). This acts as a container for your agents, data, and team members. Create a new Space for each client or internal project to keep everything organized.

2.  **Invite Team Members & Assign Roles**
    Once your Space is ready, [invite your colleagues](/docs/account-management/organization-management) or clients. As they join, assign them specific [Roles and Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) like `Admin`, `Editor`, or `Viewer` to define exactly what they can do within that Space.

3.  **Share Credentials with The Vault**
    If your agents need to connect to third-party services like OpenAI or Google, add the necessary API keys to the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault). This allows team members to build powerful agents without ever needing to handle sensitive credentials directly.
