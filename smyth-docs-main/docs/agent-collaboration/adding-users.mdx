You can invite people to your agent either from the **Share** button inside Studio or by adding them directly to the space. Both paths work, but each one affects roles and access differently.

<InfoCallout title="Sharing agents adds users to the space">
When you invite someone to an agent, they are automatically added to the [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/) that owns that agent.
</InfoCallout>

## Add Users from Studio

Use the Share button inside the agent builder when you want to quickly bring someone in.

1. Open the agent in Studio
2. Click **Share** in the top-right
3. Enter the user’s **email**
4. Click **Add More** if needed
5. Click **Send Invitations**

<WarningCallout title="Seat limits apply">
You’ll see how many seats remain. If all are used, inviting someone will add $39/month to your bill. [See what each plan includes](/docs/account-management/overview).
</WarningCallout>

## Add Users from the Space

If you want to assign a role up front or manage more than one agent, use the space-level invite flow.

1. Go to the [space dashboard](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/)
2. Click **Invite Members**
3. Add their **email**
4. Select their **role**
5. Click **Send Invite**

<InfoCallout title="Invites are space-specific">
Users must be invited into each space they need access to. They must also be part of your [organization](/docs/account-management/organization-management) before being added to a space.
</InfoCallout>

## Remove Users

To revoke access from an agent or space:

1. Open [Space Settings](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/)
2. Click **Manage Members**
3. Find the user
4. Click **Remove** or change their **role**

<WarningCallout title="Removing users from a space removes all agent access">
Since agent access is tied to the space, removing someone from the space will remove their access to every agent inside it.
</WarningCallout>

## Default Role Behavior

When someone is invited and no role is selected, SmythOS assigns a default.

- In a [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/), the default role is always **Super Admin**
- In an [organization](/docs/account-management/organization-management), the default is whatever role is selected under [Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions)
- If no role is defined in the Roles settings, **Super Admin** is used by default

<InfoCallout title="Control default roles">
To change who gets what by default, go to the [Roles](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) page and set the default there.
</InfoCallout>

## FAQs

### What happens if I invite someone to an agent?

They’re added to the agent and the space. You’ll manage their role from the [space settings](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/).

### Can I set the role when inviting from the agent?

No. If you need to control the role, use the invite option from the space instead.

### How do I check how many seats I have left?

Seat usage and limits are shown in the Share modal. You can also compare limits in [Compare Plans and Features](/docs/account-management/overview).

### Can I remove someone from a specific agent?

No. To remove them from an agent, you’ll need to remove them from the space it belongs to.
