# Agent Bulk Work

Use **Bulk Work** to run one of your agent’s endpoints across many inputs at once. Whether you're generating summaries, classifying data, or testing prompt variations. This tool lets you scale without writing scripts or calling the API manually.

<InfoCallout title="Why Bulk Work matters">
It’s perfect for processing structured inputs like contact lists, user queries, or product data without needing a developer.
</InfoCallout>

## Add Input Data

You have two ways to supply data:

### Option 1: Enter rows manually

- Click **Add Row**
- Fill in values for each required input
- Add more rows as needed

This is helpful for quick tests or small batches.

### Option 2: Upload a CSV file

- Click **Upload CSV**
- Your header row must exactly match the endpoint input names

<WarningCallout title="Header row must match input fields">
If the CSV column names don’t match the required inputs exactly, your upload will fail. Double-check spelling and casing.
</WarningCallout>
