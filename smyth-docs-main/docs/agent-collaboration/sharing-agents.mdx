You can quickly share your deployed agents with teammates, collaborators, or clients even if they don't they have a SmythOS account.

## Sharing via Email

- **Add one or more email addresses** in the Share modal.

<Image src="/docs/img/agent_collaboration/share-agent-modal.jpg" alt="Agent Share Modal" caption="Sharing an agent gives space-level access. Invitations are tied to your seat limits." />

- You can invite:
  - Users already in your [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)
  - Users outside your space (they’ll be added to the relevant space automatically)
  - New users without SmythOS accounts (they’ll be prompted to sign up)

<SuccessCallout title="No SmythOS account? No problem.">
Anyone can receive a share invitation. If they don’t have an account yet, they’ll be onboarded via email.
</SuccessCallout>

## Sharing Across Spaces

If your agent lives in a space the user isn’t part of:

- They will be **automatically added** to that space when shared.
- Their access level depends on the default [role settings](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) or manual overrides by an Admin.

<TipCallout title="Spaces control access">
Agents live inside [spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces), so make sure the space is properly configured before sharing.
