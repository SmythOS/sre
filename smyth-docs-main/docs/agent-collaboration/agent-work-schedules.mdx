# Agent Work Schedules

Use **Work Schedules** to tell your agent when to run a task. You choose the endpoint, set the input, and define when it should execute. Once it’s set up, SmythOS handles the rest with no manual triggering needed.

Great for sending daily updates, generating weekly reports, or syncing systems at regular intervals.

## Run a Task Once

If you want the agent to perform something just once at a later time:

1. Choose the endpoint
2. Add the required input values
3. Set **Repeat** to `No Repeat`
4. Pick the exact time it should run
5. (Optional) Name the task
6. Click **Done**

That’s it. It will execute once and won’t repeat.

## Set Up a Recurring Task

To make your agent run on a repeating schedule:

1. Choose the endpoint
2. Add the input values
3. Set **Repeat** to `Repeat`
4. Choose:
   - **How often** (daily, weekly, etc.)
   - **When** (specific day/time)
   - **End condition** (never, after X runs, or on a date)
5. (Optional) Add a name
6. Click **Done**

The agent will follow this schedule until you change or remove it.

## View and Manage Your Schedules

Once a schedule is saved, it appears in the **Schedule** list for that agent.

Click any item to view:

- **Info tab**: inputs, endpoint, and next run
