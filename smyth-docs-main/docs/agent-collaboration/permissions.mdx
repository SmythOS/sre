# Roles and Permissions

Roles in SmythOS define what users can see or do across the platform. They apply at both the space level and the organization level. You can use predefined roles or create your own in [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management).

<InfoCallout title="Where roles apply">
Roles are enforced across agents, spaces, and org-level tools like billing, analytics, and team access.
</InfoCallout>

## Assigning Roles

You can assign a role:

- When inviting a teammate to a [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)
- From the **Team Settings** inside a space
- From the **Roles tab** in [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management)

If you're adding someone via the **Share Agent** option in Studio, they are automatically added to the agent’s space and assigned the default space-level role.

<TipCallout title="Need to add or remove teammates?">
See the [Add or Remove Users](/docs/agent-collaboration/adding-users) guide for step-by-step instructions.
</TipCallout>

## Default Roles in New Spaces

By default, new members added through Studio or dashboard invites get the default role set in your [Roles Settings](/docs/account-management/organization-management). If no role is configured, new members are assigned **Super Admin**.

<InfoCallout title="Manage defaults">
You can configure the default role in [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management).
</InfoCallout>

## Creating Custom Roles

If predefined roles don’t fit, you can create custom roles from the [Roles tab](/docs/account-management/organization-management) in your org settings.

To create a custom role:

1. Open your **Profile Menu**
2. Select **Organization Management**
3. Click the **Roles tab**
4. Click **Create Role**
5. Name the role, toggle **Manage Team** if needed
6. Choose **View** and **Edit** access for each category

<Image src="/docs/img/agent_collaboration/organization-create-role.jpg" alt="Create a role with custom permissions" caption="You can fully customize access for any role." />

<InfoCallout title="Manage Team explained">
The Manage Team toggle allows users with that role to invite or remove others and update role assignments.
</InfoCallout>

## Managing Roles

To change, update, or delete a role:

- Navigate to **Organization Management**

You can only delete a role if it’s not assigned to any users.

<SuccessCallout title="Default roles">
