# Data Spaces

**Data Spaces** are named containers in the [Data Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool) that hold files or URLs. These sources are indexed using vector embeddings so your agents can retrieve and use them through **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.

<InfoCallout title="What makes Data Spaces useful">
Once indexed, your sources become part of your agent’s contextual knowledge. This allows agents to answer questions, summarise content, and reference details from those documents in real time.
</InfoCallout>

## How to Create a Data Space

1. Open the **Data Pool** from the left navigation
2. Click **Add Data Space**
3. Enter a name and confirm

<Image src="/docs/img/data_pool/data_spaces/create-data-space-popup.jpg" alt="Create Data Space modal" caption="Each Data Space represents a dedicated container of searchable documents." />

<SuccessCallout title="Space created">
The new space appears in your list. It will initially show **No data source** and **Not Indexed**.
</SuccessCallout>

## How to Add Sources

Each Data Space can include one or more sources:

1. Click the **Add Data Source** icon next to a space
2. Enter a label
3. Choose one of the following:
   - Upload a file (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xml`)
   - Add a URL or sitemap

<TipCallout title="Label clearly for easier reference">
Use titles like “2024 Pricing Guide” instead of generic names like “Document 1.”
</TipCallout>

## How Indexing Works

Indexing starts automatically once a source is added. You can track progress in the **Indexing Status** column. Agents can only retrieve from sources marked **Indexed**.

<InfoCallout title="Behind the scenes">
Indexing turns your files into vector embeddings. These are stored in your default or [Custom Storage](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/custom-storage) setup and made available to agents via semantic search.
</InfoCallout>

## Manage and Organize Spaces

From the Data Pool overview:

- Click a row to view or edit a Data Space
- Add or remove sources at any time
- Duplicate or delete a Data Space

<WarningCallout title="Deleting a space is permanent">
Removing a Data Space also deletes all its sources. Agents depending on this data will no longer have access to it.
</WarningCallout>

## Use Data Spaces in Agents

To connect a Data Space to an agent:

1. Open your [Project Space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)
2. Select or create an agent
3. Attach one or more Data Spaces

Once connected, the agent uses semantic retrieval to reference indexed content during execution.

<SuccessCallout title="Instant RAG support">
After attaching a space, your agent can immediately start pulling context from it in responses and workflows.

## FAQ

### What types of sources are supported?

You can upload `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.xml` files, or add URLs and full sitemaps.

### Can a single space contain both files and URLs?

Yes. Data Spaces can mix multiple file types and links.

### Is there a limit to how many sources I can add?

There is no enforced limit. For better performance and organisation, group similar content across separate spaces.

### What if indexing fails?

Check file type and size. Retry if needed, or consider using [Custom Storage](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/custom-storage) for more control.
