# Custom Storage

**Custom Storage** lets you connect your own vector database, such as Pinecone, to handle document embeddings outside of SmythOS. This gives you full control over storage, scaling, and retrieval logic, especially in enterprise or multi-agent environments.

<InfoCallout title="Why use Custom Storage?">
Use Custom Storage if you need external access to your vector data, want to scale embedding limits, or plan to share the same data across multiple agents or systems.
</InfoCallout>

## How it works

When Custom Storage is enabled, all indexing operations from your [Data Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/data-spaces) write directly to the external vector store. SmythOS fetches context from there during retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

This setup is managed from the [Data Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool).

## Pinecone setup

To use Pinecone:

1. Create an account at [pinecone.io](https://www.pinecone.io/)
2. Create an index with:
   - **Dimension**: `1536`
   - **Environment**: e.g. `us-west4-gcp`
3. Copy the following values from your Pinecone dashboard:
   - **API Key**
   - **Index Name**
   - **Index Host URL**
   - **Region/Environment**
4. In SmythOS Studio, open **Data Pool**
5. Click **Customize Storage**
6. Paste your Pinecone credentials into the form
7. Save configuration

<WarningCallout title="Vector dimension must be 1536">
SmythOS requires a vector dimension of 1536 to match the embedding model format. Other values will not work.

<TipCallout title="Most users can start with internal storage">
If you are unsure whether you need Custom Storage, begin with the default setup. You can migrate later if needed.
