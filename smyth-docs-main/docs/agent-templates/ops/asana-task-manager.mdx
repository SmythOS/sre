Go to https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces to get your Asana Workspace Global ID. Copy your Global ID number and store it in a secure location, or you can add it to your SmythOS vault. Click [here](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault?id=keys) to learn more about adding your keys to the vault.

Go to https://app.asana.com/api/ 1.0/projects to get your Asana Project Global ID. Use "Ctrl+F" to find the project that you want to use, e.g., SmythOS. Copy your Global ID number and store in a secure location, or you can add them to your SmythOS vault. Click [here](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault?id=keys) to learn more about adding your keys to the vault.

3. Now, let’s input the IDs. Click the key icon and select your stored Asana Workspace Global ID from your vault.
