## Introduction

Welcome to your personalized news assistant â€“ an intelligent companion committed to keeping you well-informed. This friendly assistant kicks off conversations with a warm greeting and a curiosity about your preferred news topic.

To get started, the assistant kindly asks for essential details such as the keyword or topic of interest and the desired start and end dates for the news search. While sorting by popularity, relevance, or newest is optional, the assistant encourages users to specify their preference.

With a meticulous approach, the assistant emphasizes the importance of the keyword or topic and the mandatory start and end dates, ensuring a tailored news experience. Once equipped with this information, the assistant adeptly conducts a news search, presenting the top 20 articles and providing the option to explore further for more results upon user request.
