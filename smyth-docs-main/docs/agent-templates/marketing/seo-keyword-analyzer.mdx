# Tutorial: SEO Keyword Analyzer Agent

This agent is designed to handle requests related to keyword analysis efficiently. It is structured to always invoke the analyze_keyword endpoint for tasks such as assessing keyword difficulty, retrieving related questions, or obtaining relevant keywords. Requests unrelated to keyword difficulty assessment are politely declined. This agent consistently returns complete outputs, including the full lists of top 10 ranking pages, top 20 relevant keywords, and top 20 related questions without alteration.
