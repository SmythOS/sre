## Zapier API Key Setup

This agent uses the `Zapier AI` Actions component to automate folder creation on Dropbox. Zapier stands as a pivotal tool that interlinks various apps, enabling the automation of workflows. Its core functionality revolves around actions which are automated tasks that seamlessly connect two or more applications, eliminating the need for manual task handling.

1. Navigate to the [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) website. If you do not have an account yet, proceed to create one by following the registration process. Skip this process if you already have an account and proceed to login.

2. Go to this [link](https://actions.zapier.com/credentials/) to get your Zapier API key. Click the ‘click to reveal’ then copy your API key.

5. After saving your API key, you'll be redirected automatically to the [https://actions.zapier.com/custom/actions/](https://actions.zapier.com/custom/actions/) page. Here, you're able to add new actions and make modifications to your existing Zapier actions. Type `Dropbox` on the Action input field, then select `Dropbox: Create Folder` from the list.
