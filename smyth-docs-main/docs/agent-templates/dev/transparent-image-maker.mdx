# Tutorial: Transparent Image Maker Agent

This agent specializes in removing image backgrounds. If you have a photo from which you require the background to be removed, this is your go-to solution. This agent can help you isolate the subject from its surroundings, unclutter the image, and improve its focus. This can be particularly helpful for product images, professional headshots, or any image that you want to customize for different needs.
