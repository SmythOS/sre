> When working with templates or agents that use external API services, you can leverage the Mock Data feature for API Call components during testing and debugging:
>
>1. Enable **Debug Mode** in the toolbar at the top of the Builder
>2. Select an API Call component that uses API keys from the Vault
>3. In the component settings, enable the **Use Mock Data** toggle
>4. Define the mock response data you want the component to return
>5. Run your workflow to test without needing actual API credentials

> **Pro Tip:** The Mock Data feature is perfect for testing third-party integrations without having to register for multiple external services. Learn more about [Mock Data configuration](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call#step-5-enable-mock-mode).

## Deploy the Agent in Your Workflow

Once the setup is complete, deploy your agent to make it live and ready for integration into your workflow. SmythOS automatically provides a production subdomain for your deployed agent (e.g., `xyz.agent.pa.smyth.ai`), but you can also configure your own custom subdomain.

Key deployment features:
- • Automatic SSL/TLS certification
- • Built-in rate limiting
- • Request logging and monitoring
- • Version control and rollback capabilities
