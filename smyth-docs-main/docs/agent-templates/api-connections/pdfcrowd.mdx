## How to Get Your API Key

Follow these steps to obtain and securely store your PDFCrowd credentials:

1. Visit [pdfcrowd.com](https://pdfcrowd.com/) and **create an account** if you don’t already have one.
2. After logging in, go to the left sidebar and click **“API v2 License.”**
3. Locate your **API Key** on that page.
4. **Copy your API Key** and store it somewhere safe.

<TipCallout title="Use Vault for secure storage">
We recommend storing your API key in the [SmythOS Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) for secure, managed access across your agents.
