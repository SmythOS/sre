# Model Rates

Use this page to check what each model or system service costs before you deploy. Knowing the base rates will help you make the most of your credits whether you're running agents for development, production, or scale.

<InfoCallout title="Good to know">
If you're using SmythOS-recommended models, you don't need API keys. We handle setup, cost tracking, and rate scaling based on your plan.

### What counts as a task?

Each successful component execution in a deployed agent equals one task. No charges apply for failed runs or dev environment tests.

| Example                                | Tasks Counted |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| 3 components in chat                   | 3 tasks       |
| 100 rows, 2 components each (bulk run) | 200 tasks     |
| Failed run                             | 0 tasks       |
| Testing in builder                     | 0 tasks       |

<WarningCallout title="Production only">
Tasks are only counted when your agent is deployed. The development version is always free to run and test.
