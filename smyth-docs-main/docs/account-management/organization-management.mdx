# Organization Management

Your organization is the parent layer in SmythOS. Every space, user, and permission is scoped under it. All members must first belong to your organization before they can be added to any space.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Organization-level users control access to all [spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/). If someone isn’t in your org, they can’t join any space you manage.
</InfoCallout>

## Managing Roles

Roles define what your team can access and control across SmythOS. You can assign roles when [inviting users](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/invite-members), or update them later.

### How to access roles

1. Click your **user profile**
2. Select **Manage Roles** from the dropdown

<SuccessCallout title="Default role for new users">
You can define a default role that gets applied automatically when a user is added. If none is set, Super Admin is used.
</SuccessCallout>
