# Subscription Management

The [**My Plan**](https://app.smythos.com/my-plan) page gives you control over your current [subscription tier](/docs/account-management/overview), usage limits, billing preferences, and cancellation settings. You can access it anytime from the top-right menu of your SmythOS dashboard.

<InfoCallout title="Where to manage your plan">
Click your profile picture, choose **My Plan**, and manage everything from credit usage to plan cancellation in one place.

## View Plan and Usage

At the top of the [**My Plan** page](https://app.smythos.com/my-plan), you'll see your active plan summary: which tier you're on, who owns it, and your current billing cycle.

Usage metrics shown below help you track your activity in real time:

| Section             | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Use**       | How many [credits](/docs/account-management/model-rates) you’ve consumed this cycle |
| **Data Pool Usage** | Storage volume used out of your total GB quota               |
| **Active Agents**   | Total number of agents deployed this month                   |

<InfoCallout title="Credits reset automatically">
Your included credits renew monthly at the start of each new billing period.
</InfoCallout>

You can also review how your plan’s credit multiplier affects cost on the [Model Rates page](/docs/account-management/model-rates).

## Set a Billing Limit

To prevent overspending once your credits run out, you can enable a billing cap.

1. Scroll to the **Set Billing Limit** section
2. Toggle the limit on
3. Enter your billing threshold in USD

SmythOS will stop usage charges once your cap is reached.

<WarningCallout title="Limits apply after credits are used">
Credits are always used first. Billing only starts once you're over the included monthly quota.
</WarningCallout>

To monitor consumption more closely, use the [Analytics Dashboard](/docs/agent-collaboration/analytics).

## Cancel a Subscription

To downgrade to the Free plan:

1. Go to **My Plan**
2. Scroll to the **Cancel Subscription** section
3. Click **Cancel Subscription**
4. Complete the cancellation flow on Stripe

Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. After that, your account will move to the [Free Forever tier](https://smythos.com/pricing/).

<WarningCallout title="Only team owners can cancel subscriptions">
If you don’t see the cancel button, check your [role and permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions). Only the [team owner](/docs/account-management/organization-management) can cancel a subscription.
</WarningCallout>

## Role-Based Access

Your ability to cancel or manage subscriptions depends on your assigned role.

Full access is available to users with the [Super Admin role](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions), which must be set from the [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management) panel.
