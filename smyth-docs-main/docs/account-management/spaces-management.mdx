# Spaces Management

Spaces in SmythOS act as isolated workspaces, each with its own agents, resources, and team members. They help you manage access cleanly, especially when working across clients, projects, or environments.

## What is a Space?

A space is a self-contained workspace inside your SmythOS organization. It comes with its own:

- Agents and workflows
- Data and configurations
- Role-based team structure
- Branding settings

You typically create a new space when you're:

- Serving a different client
- Segmenting dev vs production environments
- Separating internal departments or product lines

<InfoCallout>
Each space keeps agents, data, and configurations private unless intentionally shared.
</InfoCallout>

## Core Actions

You can manage your spaces from the dropdown in the top right corner.

### Create a Space

1. Click your [organization name](/docs/account-management/organization-management) in the top-right corner of the dashboard  
2. Select [**Create New Space**](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)
3. Name your space and optionally add a description
4. Invite initial team members

### Add or Remove Members

You can invite collaborators via the Space Settings panel.

1. Go to **Space Settings**
2. Enter email addresses
3. Assign roles based on what each user needs access to

To remove a member:

1. Open the member list in Space Settings
2. Click the remove icon next to their name

<WarningCallout>
Only space creators can delete a space, and they cannot remove themselves. Members cannot leave a space they were not the creator of.

## Roles and Permissions

Spaces use role-based access control. You assign one of four roles when adding a member. Here’s a quick overview of the key differences:

| Area              | Super Admin | Admin         | Editor        | Viewer        |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Edit Agents       | ✅          | ✅            | ✅            | ❌            |
| Access Agent Logs | ✅          | ✅            | ✅            | ✅            |
| Add Team Members  | ✅          | ✅            | ❌            | ❌            |
| Modify Vault Keys | ✅          | ✅            | ✅            | ❌            |
| Manage Branding   | ✅          | ✅            | ❌            | ❌            |

## Branding Your Space

Each space can be customized to match your company’s brand identity. You can upload a logo and apply consistent visuals across agent UIs.

To update branding:

1. Go to **Space Settings**
2. Click **Change Logo**
3. Upload a square image (recommended size: 256x256px)

This applies your brand identity to all agent interfaces in the space.

## Team Chat in Spaces

Each space comes with an optional internal chat channel for collaboration. You can use this to:

- Coordinate with teammates
- Share updates about agent builds
- Ask questions and assign follow-up

Spaces with chat enabled have a dedicated messaging section. See [Team Spaces Chat](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/team-spaces-chat) for usage tips.

## Space Deletion Rules

You can only delete a space if you created it. Before deletion:

1. Remove all agents, subdomains, and members
2. Ensure no active deployments or billing ties
3. Then proceed to delete from **Space Settings**

<WarningCallout title="Double check before space deletion">
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
