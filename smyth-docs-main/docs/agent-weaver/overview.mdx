# Build Agents with Weaver

**Weaver** is the prompt-first interface in SmythOS that lets you build AI agents by simply describing what you want. Unlike traditional agent builder tools that ask you to think like a developer, Weaver is task-oriented: you describe goals; Weaver builds.  

<InfoCallout title="What is Weaver?">
Weaver lets you describe your automation goal in natural language. It interprets your prompt, builds the logic, and delivers a working agent ready to run.
</InfoCallout>

Weaver transforms your text instructions into complete, testable workflows without needing to write a single line of code.
It’s where your prompt becomes agent... and your typing becomes *Smyth-ing*.

## Understand Agent Weaver in 3 Minutes
While **Studio** gives you a classic drag-and-drop canvas for building agents manually, **Weaver starts with natural conversation** in a single prompt box.

> Just describe what you need. Weaver thinks, plans, and builds it for you; piece by piece.

Here’s how it works:

1. **You describe your goal**  
   _e.g. "Help me write SEO-optimized articles for my blog about calculators"_

2. **Weaver interprets your intent**  
   It enters a “Thinking...” state where it analyzes what kind of agent you might need.

3. **It asks clarifying questions**  
   Weaver ensures it gets things right by prompting you for context like:
   - Which platforms you publish to  
   - What type or tone of content you prefer  
   - Whether you need research assistance or just writing  

4. **It proposes a workflow plan**  
   Example:
   - Generate blog structure  
   - Write full content  
   - Research topics  
   - Publish (optional)

5. **Weaver auto-creates the workflow**  
   Using skills from the **SmythOS library**, Weaver:
   - Picks components  
   - Connects them based on data needs  
   - Assigns inputs/outputs, types, and even color codes

6. **You test, tweak, and ship within chat**  
   Just type. No config panels, no handoffs, no code.

> Behind the scenes, Weaver behaves like a **LLM orchestration engine** paired with a smart schema-aware composer, but you never see the wiring unless you want to.

-> Try a prompt like:  
<PromptCard prompt="Create a research agent that finds product reviews and summarizes them in markdown." />

This makes Weaver the fastest way to **build AI agents in SmythOS**.

## Why We Built Weaver

Before Weaver, building an agent felt like coding a backend from scratch: wiring APIs, managing logic, handling retries... all before the real work even started.
That's why Weaver is so powerful. It is a true no-code agent orchestration tool.
Now you just **ask** for what you want. Explain what you need to *Weave* your AI agent:

**Prompt → Skill Suggestions → Visual Flow → Live Test → Fix/Deploy**

It’s not just easier... it’s friendlier, faster, and far more forgiving for anyone.

>- All SmythOS plans (free and paid) include free credits to use tools in the app, including Agent Weaver.
>- **After exhausting credits:** Users are limited to 5 requests per 24 hours.
>- **Credit restoration:** Credits are automatically restored at the beginning of each month.

## Key Features of Weaver

## How to Get Started with Weaver

We call this flow **Chat-to-Agent**:

1. **Describe the agent**:  
   <PromptCard prompt="Create an agent that writes SEO articles and posts to WordPress."/>
2. **(Optionally) list its skills**:  
   <PromptCard prompt="The agent should have the following skills...It should write SEO-optimised articles, extract primary and secondary keywords, and post content to Wordpress."/>
3. **Weaver thinks aloud and asks smart questions**  
   Weaver responds with a **preview of its planned workflows**, then follows up with clarifying questions like:  
   - *What kind of blogs are you targeting?*  
   - *Do you want keyword extraction to be optional or required?*  
   - *Which CMS platform are you using — WordPress.com or self-hosted?*
4. **Weaver maps those into 3 components:**
- GenAI LLM (to write the article)
- Classifier (to extract keywords)
- APICall (to post the content)
5. **It wires them into a functional layout**... like magic, but with schema integrity. Weaver also sets names, descriptions, inputs, and outputs, ensuring clarity and relevance.
6. **Test the agent directly in chat.**
7. **Fix any breakage with a single click or asking Weaver to fix the issues by prompting it.**
8. **Deploy and go live without writing any code.**

> Weaver even lets you attach images or flow diagrams to describe what you want.  
> Great for visual thinkers, or folks who like whiteboarding their way through a build.

## Fixing with AI

Component break? Happens to the best of us. Weaver gives you:

- Input/output previews  
- A **"Fix with AI"** button  
- The ability to select and debug multiple components (`Cmd/Ctrl + click` is your friend)
- Weaver rewrites only what’s broken or selected -> Your agent keeps running; no blanket rebuild required.

<InfoCallout title="You're in control with Weaver">Weaver doesn’t try to fix the entire agent unless you ask it to. </InfoCallout>

## Inside Weaver

Weaver combines:

- **Prompt parsing** to identify goals and intent  
- **Skill suggestion** based on our core component library  
- **Dependency mapping** to auto-wire your logic  
- **Live doc search** to answer product questions... yes, even *"How do I upgrade?"*

It’s fast, helpful, and never passive-aggressive.

## Understand Key Concepts of Weaver

| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------------------|
| [**Agent**](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/agent-overview) | Task-running bot powered by LLMs & skills |
| [**Workflow**](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/building-workflows) | Sequence of components linked by inputs/outputs |
| [**Component**](/docs/agent-studio/components) |  A single block that performs a task (API call, generation, classification, etc.)  (`●` mandatory · `○` optional) |

You can learn more about input/output design and flow behavior in the [Weaver I/O guide](/docs/agent-weaver/input-output), and explore how Weaver handles broken logic in the [debugging section](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents).

<InfoCallout title="Behind the scenes">
Weaver uses a smart orchestration engine that understands prompts, assigns components, and preserves schema structure across complex workflows.
</InfoCallout>

## Start Building with Weaver

Weaver supports both simple and multi-step use cases for [building agents](/docs/agent-weaver/quickstart), such as:

- Blog writing and publishing  
- Email sequence automation  
- Market research + summarization  
- Internal reporting workflows  

Weaver encourages:

- Task-based thinking (“extract keywords” > “run NLP”)  
- Smaller, focused workflows  
- Reuse over reinvention

<TipCallout title="Fix with AI">
If a component breaks, use Weaver’s contextual AI repair. It suggests or implements changes only for the affected block.
</TipCallout>

## Who Should Use Weaver? (Hint: Probably You Soon)

- Ops leads converting checklists into automations  
- PMs prototyping in a **SmythOS AI design environment**  
- Analysts who want results
- Developers who’d rather start at 80 % than 0 %

If you’ve ever thought *“I know what I want, I just don’t know how to build it,”* Weaver’s for you.

<InfoCallout title="Weaver is for everyone">
No matter if you're an ops lead, content strategist, or developer, Weaver makes automation more accessible.
