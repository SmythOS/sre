## 1. Browse the Componenet Library

1. Click [Templates](https://app.smythos.com/templates) in the left sidebar.  
2. Filter by **category** (marketing, sales, dev) or just type to search.
3. Click on a card to get a quick look at what the template does.
4. If you want one that's not there, click on **Request a Template** and fill up a form for what you need.

## 2. Remix in One Click

*Click “Remix”* and Weaver drops the template onto your canvas:

- All skills are duplicated under a new agent ID (safe editing).  
- Variables (e.g., `{{api_key}}`) are flagged as "Missing Key `{{api_key_name}}`" under the respective components.

### FAQ: Do my remixes update when the original template changes?

No. Remix creates a full copy for you that you control.
