# Subdomains

Use subdomains to host your agents on custom, branded URLs. SmythOS supports custom subdomain verification through DNS and lets you connect verified domains directly during deployment.

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR – Custom Domains in SmythOS">
You can connect your own subdomains (like `support.yourdomain.com`) to host agents deployed via SmythOS.  
Add a subdomain → Verify it via DNS → Use it during deployment to serve your agent on a branded URL.

## Add a New Subdomain

To link a custom subdomain to your agent:

1. **Click `Add Subdomain`**  
   - You'll find this in the **Subdomains** section of your workspace.

2. **Enter the Subdomain**  
   - Input the subdomain you'd like to use (e.g. `support.yourcompany.com`)  
   - Click `Next` to move to the DNS verification step.

3. **Register a CNAME Record**  
   - Copy the CNAME and target values shown.  
   - Add them to your DNS provider's dashboard.

<InfoCallout title="DNS Propagation Time">
DNS changes can take up to **24 hours** to propagate. During this time, verification may temporarily fail.
</InfoCallout>

4. **Verify**  
   - After saving the DNS record, return to SmythOS and click `Verify`.  
   - If successful, your subdomain will be listed as "Verified".

<WarningCallout title="Cloudflare Users">
If you're using **Cloudflare** for DNS, set the Proxy status to **DNS Only** (gray cloud) instead of **Proxied** (orange cloud).  
Proxied records will prevent domain verification from working.
</WarningCallout>

## Use a Verified Subdomain for Deployment

Once verified, your subdomain can be selected when deploying any agent.

1. Go to your agent’s **Deploy** screen.  
2. Choose a version and fill out the details.  
3. In the domain dropdown, select your verified subdomain.  
4. Complete the deployment.

Your agent will now be live on your custom URL.

## Delete a Subdomain

1. **Click `Delete`**  
   - Found next to the subdomain in the list.

2. **Confirm**  
   - Type the subdomain name when prompted and click `Delete` again to confirm removal.

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

To stay organized, use descriptive and structured naming:

- Use a consistent pattern, e.g.:
 `{agent-name}.agents.yourdomain.com`

- Keep names short but clear.

### Multi-Agent Workspaces
<InfoCallout title="One DNS Zone, Many Subdomains">
Managing many agents under one domain is supported. Just verify each subdomain individually within your DNS zone.
</InfoCallout>

- You can verify and use multiple subdomains in a single SmythOS workspace.  
- Each subdomain must be added and verified separately, even if they share a root domain.
