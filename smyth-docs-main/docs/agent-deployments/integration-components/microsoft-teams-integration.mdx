# Use Microsoft Teams with SmythOS

> Add your SmythOS agents into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Integrate chat, collaboration, and workflow automation directly into your agents with Microsoft Teams support.

<InfoCallout> **TL;DR:** Register an Azure app, add Microsoft Graph API permissions, store your credentials in Vault, and plug in Teams chat components to automate interactions. </InfoCallout>

## Why Use Microsoft Teams With Your Agent?

Microsoft Teams is a hub for workplace communication. It combines messaging, meetings, file sharing, and integration with apps. Embedding it in your agents lets you:

- Centralize alerts and workflows inside the tools your team already uses
- Create conversational interfaces with live users
- Automate message handling and channel updates

With SmythOS, this becomes a no-code/low-code extension of your existing agent logic.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- You need a Microsoft 365 tenant and access to the [Microsoft Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
- Your app must be registered in Azure with Microsoft Graph API enabled
- Your SmythOS agent should be deployed with [Vault access configured](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)

## Step 1: Register an Azure App

1. Visit the [Microsoft Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory → App registrations → New registration**
3. Fill out:
   - Name: `SmythOS Agent App`
   - Redirect URI: `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback`
   - Account type: choose based on internal vs external use
4. Click **Register**

<InfoCallout> After registration, copy your **Client ID** and **Tenant ID** because you’ll use them in Vault. </InfoCallout>

## Step 2: Add Microsoft Graph API Permissions

1. Go to your app → **API Permissions**
2. Add permissions under **Microsoft Graph**:
   - `Chat.Read`, `Chat.ReadWrite`
   - `Channel.ReadBasic.All`, `Team.ReadBasic.All`
   - `offline_access`
3. Click **Grant admin consent** to apply

## Step 3: Create a Client Secret

1. In the app, go to **Certificates & secrets → New client secret**
2. Name it, set expiry, and save the generated value

## Step 4: Store in SmythOS Vault

1. Open SmythOS → **Vault → API Keys → Add Key**
2. Add your credentials securely:
   - `client_id`
   - `client_secret`
   - `tenant_id`
