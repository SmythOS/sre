# Use Slack with SmythOS

> Connect your agents to Slack for real-time team communication, automated alerts, and contextual interactions via components or Model Context Protocol (MCP).

<InfoCallout> **TL;DR:** Authenticate your Slack app, configure the Send Message component, or deploy using [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](//docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server) to route intelligent agent outputs into Slack. </InfoCallout>

## Why Use Slack With Your Agent?

Slack is a core communication tool for modern teams. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to:

- Trigger alerts, summaries, or updates from automated workflows
- Send messages based on logic, triggers, or API events
- Send alerts or summaries directly to teams
- Build chatOps flows for faster task execution
- Route responses from AI agents into Slack threads
- Customize interactions based on channel, user, or context

With both direct Slack component integration **and** Model Context Protocol (MCP), you can choose how and where Slack fits in.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- A Slack Workspace and Slack App
- Bot User enabled with messaging scopes
- Your **Bot User OAuth Token**
- Optional: Store the token in [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)

## Option 1: Send Slack Messages Using the Component

### Step 1: Get Your Slack Bot Token

1. Create a Slack App at [Slack API Console](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Enable the Bot User under **App Features**
3. Install the app under **OAuth & Permissions**
4. Copy your **Bot User OAuth Token**
5. Add it manually or store it in Vault

<InfoCallout> Use Vault for secure, multi-agent reuse and better token management. </InfoCallout>

### Step 2: Configure the Send Message Component

Open the Slack **Send Message** component in your workflow.

- Set authentication to use Vault key or paste token
- Define inputs for your message

```json
{
  "channel_id": "C12345678",
  "text": "Your agent has completed the task."
}
```

**Inputs Required:**
- `channel_id`: ID of the Slack channel
- `text`: Message content (≤ 2000 characters)

### Step 3: Output Structure

Once the message sends, the outputs include:

- `response`: Full Slack message object
- `headers`: Metadata from Slack API
- `status`: HTTP status code
- `msgObj`: Message ID, content, timestamp

## Option 2: Deploy Slack Integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

If your agent uses memory, roles, or multi-modal workflows, deploy with [MCP](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server) to:

- Route outputs to Slack after deeper context processing
- Combine Slack notifications with email, Discord, or logging
- Enable multi-agent collaboration across departments

**Sample Payload to MCP:**
```json
{
  "input": "New ticket submitted in support.",
  "platform": "slack",
  "channel_id": "C024BE91L"
}
```

Follow this with a `Send Message` component for delivery.

<InfoCallout> MCP is best for routing Slack messages after memory/context-based decision logic. </InfoCallout>

## What’s Next?

- Attach Slack messaging to your [Chatbot Interface](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatbot)
- Use [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) to manage tokens securely
- Track delivery and failures using [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs)
