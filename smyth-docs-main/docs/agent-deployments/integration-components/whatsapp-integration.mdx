# Use WhatsApp with SmythOS

> Bring your agents to where your users are, WhatsApp. With over 2 billion users, it's a must-have messaging channel for real-time, human-like communication.

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR">Choose from three WhatsApp integration paths: MCP Server, Meta WhatsApp Business API, or Twilio. All allow your SmythOS agent to receive and send messages over WhatsApp. </InfoCallout>

## Why Use WhatsApp With Your Agent?

WhatsApp is a global messaging leader trusted by individuals, businesses, and governments alike. With SmythOS:

- Turn your agent into a conversational partner on WhatsApp
- Automate customer service, order updates, reminders, and more
- Support rich message flows, multilingual handling, and conditional responses

## Deployment Options

You can deploy your WhatsApp-connected agent in three ways:

1. **[MCP Server Deployment](//docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server):** Recommended for control, branding, and reliability.
2. **Meta WhatsApp Business API:** Official but complex.
3. **Twilio WhatsApp API:** Simple to set up and test, with additional service cost.

## Option 1: Deploy to MCP Server (Recommended)

### Step 1: Deploy Your Agent to MCP

Follow the instructions in [Deploy to MCP Server](//docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server) to get your agent running on a stable, serverless endpoint.

### Step 2: Connect to WhatsApp

You can now register this MCP endpoint as your **Webhook URL** with:

- **Meta WhatsApp Cloud API**
- **Twilio WhatsApp settings**

This allows WhatsApp to push incoming messages directly to your agent.

### Step 3: Handle WhatsApp Webhooks

Create an Agent Skill (or Code Component) to:

- Accept incoming messages
- Parse fields like `sender`, `timestamp`, and `text`
- Forward them into your agent’s reasoning and response flow

### Step 4: Respond to Users with API calls

Use an **API Call** component to send replies. You’ll:

- Format payloads based on WhatsApp API (see examples below)
- Use Meta’s or Twilio’s URL, depending on integration path

### Key Benefits

- Doesn’t require Facebook Business verification
- Lets you use custom or regional gateways
- Highly customizable and scalable
- Ideal for global or regulated deployments

3. **Create Meta App**, add the **WhatsApp product**
4. **Register a phone number**, save your **Phone Number ID**
5. **Generate Access Token** and store it in [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)
6. **Configure Webhook** to point to your MCP agent’s endpoint
7. **Create API Call Component** in SmythOS:

```json
{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "to": "${recipient}",
  "type": "text",
  "text": {
    "body": "${message}"
  }
}
```

- Endpoint: `https://graph.facebook.com/v13.0/{phone-number-id}/messages`
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer {access-token}`

## Option 3: Twilio WhatsApp API (Easy Setup)

### Prerequisites

- Twilio account
- WhatsApp sandbox setup
- MCP agent with deployed endpoint

### Step-by-Step

2. **Copy your Account SID and Auth Token**, store in [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)
3. **Configure Webhook** to MCP agent URL
4. **Create API Call Component**:

```json
{
  "From": "whatsapp:{your-twilio-number}",
  "To": "whatsapp:{recipient}",
  "Body": "${message}"
}
```

- Endpoint: `https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSID}/Messages.json`
- Use HTTP Basic Auth (SID + Auth Token)

## What’s Next?

- Add [logging for incoming messages](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs)
- Chain WhatsApp input into LLM-based responses or workflows
