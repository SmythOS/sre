# Use Discord with SmythOS

> Send real-time updates, automate community responses, or just drop a message into a Discord server... right from your SmythOS agent.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Add your Discord Bot Token, configure channel and message inputs, and plug the component into any workflow, including MCP deployments.

## Why Use Discord With Your Agent?

Discord isn’t just for gamers. It’s a powerhouse for real-time conversations, communities, and automation. With the **Send Message** component, you can:

- Post real-time updates from your agent
- Push notifications from workflows and conditional logic
- Sync backend events with your community
- Automate community interaction from your product, CRM, or custom data store

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Discord:

- Create a [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Add a bot to the application to generate a **Bot Token**
- [Invite the bot to your server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links) with `Send Messages` permission
- Optionally configure [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) for securely managing your Bot Token

## Step-by-Step: Integrate Discord

### Step 1: Add Your Bot Token

1. Open your app in the Discord Developer Portal
2. Go to the **Bot** tab
3. Copy the **Bot Token**
4. In SmythOS, paste the token into the component’s settings under **Bot Token**

<InfoCallout>
Keep your Bot Token secure in [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).
</InfoCallout>

### Step 2: Configure Component Settings

Inside the **Send Message** component, set:

- **Bot Token**: Add from Vault or directly in settings

This authorizes your bot to send messages to your target server and channel.

### Step 3: Define Inputs

Here’s a sample payload:

```json
{
  "channel_id": "123456789012345678",
  "content": "Hello, Discord! This is your SmythOS agent speaking."
}
```

Required:

- **channel_id**: Copy this from Discord by right-clicking the target channel > **Copy ID**
- **content**: Your message. Supports markdown, mentions, emojis (up to 2000 characters)

<InfoCallout>
Click **+ Add Input** to pass dynamic values or support logic branches.
</InfoCallout>

<Divider />

### Step 4: Use the Outputs

After execution, you’ll get:

- **response**: JSON object with content, timestamp, bot name, and more
- **headers**: HTTP metadata
- **messageId**: The message’s unique ID for reference, updates, or logs

You can log or reference this data in follow-up steps.

## Optional: Deploy via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

If your agent is deployed using [MCP Server](//docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server), you can:

1. Set up the Discord component in the agent canvas as usual.
2. Expose this workflow endpoint via MCP using a route that maps to a Discord action.
3. Use a POST request (e.g., from an app or webhook) to hit the MCP URL, and pass the required `channel_id` and `content` values.
4. The deployed agent handles the authentication and message delivery.

<InfoCallout>
You must ensure that your bot is authorized in the server and that channel IDs passed via the API are accessible.
</InfoCallout>

This method allows external systems to trigger Discord messages without embedding the bot logic outside SmythOS.

## What’s Next?

- Combine this with [Deploy as API](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-api) to expose Discord actions externally
- Create workflows that send alerts when conditions are met
- Chain Discord outputs into custom dashboards or external tools
- Log activity with [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs)
