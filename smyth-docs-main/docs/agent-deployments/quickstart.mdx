# Quickstart to Deployment


This guide walks you through deploying an agent to **Agent Cloud**, the default runtime hosted by SmythOS. You’ll assign a version, pick a subdomain, and optionally add release notes from within the Builder.

<InfoCallout title="Looking for other deployment options?"> 
You can also deploy to **Enterprise** (on-prem or VPC) or **Local Runtime** (offline/local dev). See the [Deployments Overview](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) for more.
</InfoCallout>

## 1. Open Your Agent in the Studio

Navigate to the agent you want to deploy and open it in the [**Studio**](/docs/agent-studio/overview).

You’ll see your workflow or components already laid out.

## 2. Click `Deploy` in the Top Right

At the top of the builder, click the **Deploy** button to open the deployment panel. You can also do it from the sidebar.

## 3. Choose Your Deployment Mode

Stay on the **Agent Cloud** tab (it's the default option).

> Agent Cloud runs on SmythOS-hosted infrastructure without any setup or configuration required.

## 4. Set a Version Number

Fill in the **Major** and **Minor** version fields.

- Use a new version each time you deploy
- You can’t reuse the same version number again

Examples:
- `1.0` – First release
- `1.1` – Minor update or fix
- `2.0` – Major changes or breaking updates

Need help? See the [Versioning Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/versioning)

<WarningCallout title="Versioning Rules">
Each deployment must have a unique version number. If you're unsure how to version your changes, refer to the [Versioning Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/versioning).
</WarningCallout>

## 5. Enter a Subdomain

Choose the subdomain you want the agent to run on.

- This creates a live URL like:  
  `youragent.agent.pstage.smyth.ai`

You can also click the link in the UI to register a custom subdomain if needed.

## 6. Add Release Notes (Optional)

You can enter a short description of what changed in this version.

This appears in **Agent Settings → Deployments** and is useful for tracking updates.

### Good examples:
- `Adds data cleaning step before classification`
- `Adds PDF generation and summary step`
- `Fixes issue with Slack API formatting`

### Avoid vague notes:
- `Update agent`
- `Bugfix`
- `New stuff added`

<InfoCallout title="Why Release Notes Matter">
Clear release notes help collaborators and future you understand what changed, especially across multiple deployments.
</InfoCallout>

## 7. Click `Deploy`

SmythOS will:

- Assign the version number
- Provision a live URL
- Issue an SSL certificate
- Perform basic health checks

Once it’s ready, you’ll get a working, shareable agent URL.

## What You Get After Deployment
<TipCallout title="Deployments Are Versioned">
Each deployment is self-contained. You can release new versions without affecting previous ones. Rollback and tracking are built-in.
</TipCallout>

- A live, HTTPS-secured URL  
- Agent is locked to the version you deployed  
- Entry is listed under **Agent Settings → Deployments**

<InfoCallout title="What’s Next?">
- Want to understand how agents actually run after deployment? See the [Agent Runtime Overview](/docs/agent-runtime/overview)  
- Need to change or remove a previous deployment? Go to **Agent Settings → Deployments**  
- Curious about enterprise or local deployment options? Check the [Deployments Overview](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)
