# Agent Versioning

Each time you deploy an agent, you assign a version number using the `Major.Minor` format — for example, `1.0`, `2.3`, or `4.7`.

This versioning system helps track what’s changed between deployments, communicate updates to your team or users, and manage rollback scenarios if something breaks.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Use a new **major** version for breaking changes. Bump the **minor** version for new features or fixes that don’t break things.
</InfoCallout>

## Version Number Format

SmythOS uses **semantic-style versioning** — specifically:

[Major].[Minor]

- **Major**: Increase this when the agent changes in a way that breaks existing behavior or interface.
- **Minor**: Use this for non-breaking changes like bug fixes, new features, or configuration tweaks.

## When to Bump the Version

| Change Type                     | Example                                                                 | Version Update     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Breaking input/output changes  | Changing the expected input schema, removing a component               | `1.0 → 2.0`        |
| Adding a new feature           | Adding a summarizer component to an existing agent                     | `1.0 → 1.1`        |
| Fixing a bug                   | Correcting an API call or fixing a loop logic                          | `1.1 → 1.2`        |
| UI-only tweak (no agent change)| Updating name/description of agent or component                        | Optional           |
| Complete rebuild from scratch  | New architecture or new behavior                                       | `2.3 → 3.0`        |

<WarningCallout>
You cannot reuse a version number. Each version must be unique per agent.

## Adding Release Notes

The **Release Notes** field is optional, but helpful. This text appears in the **Agent Settings → Deployments** tab and gives anyone viewing the agent a summary of what’s new.

### Good examples:
- `Adds new classification component for content tagging`
- `Fixes bug where emails failed to send on retry`
- `Adds support for image inputs and optional PDF export`

### Bad or vague:
- `Updated agent`  
- `Fix 1`  
- `New stuff added`

Keep it short but specific. Think of it as a commit message for your agent.

## How Versioning Works in SmythOS

When you deploy an agent, you’ll see version fields like this:

<Image
  src="/docs/images/agent_deployments/deploy-version-ui.jpg"
  alt="Deploy Version UI"
  caption="Screenshot of the Deploy Version UI"
/>

- **Major** and **Minor** fields are required.
- You’ll also see the auto-generated subdomain and the optional release notes field.

If you're using [custom domains](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains), your version still applies regardless of URL.

## Notes on Version Behavior

- Each version is saved separately. You can refer back to older versions at any time.
- You can’t deploy two versions with the same number (e.g., can’t deploy `1.0` twice).
- Versions are agent-specific. Two different agents can both have a `1.0` version.

<InfoCallout title="Keep it Simple">
There’s no concept of patch or build numbers (e.g., `1.0.1`) in SmythOS. Stick with an easier way: `Major.Minor`.
