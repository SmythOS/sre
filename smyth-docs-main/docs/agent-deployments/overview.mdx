# Deploying Your Agent

SmythOS supports three deployment modes. You can start with one that fits your current setup and switch later without changing your code.

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR">
Use Agent Cloud for general use, Enterprise for private deployments, and Local Runtime for isolated development or testing.
</InfoCallout>

## Understanding Your Deployment Options

SmythOS supports three distinct deployment paths; each is designed to match a different stage of development or production use case. Here's how to choose:

- **Agent Cloud**: Perfect for most users. It’s fast, managed, and requires zero infra knowledge.
- **Enterprise Deployments**: Tailored for organizations with strict security, compliance, or hosting needs.
- **Local Runtime**: Great for isolated dev/testing environments or air-gapped prototypes.

### Comparison of Deployment Modes

| Mode              | Infrastructure     | Who It's For           | Highlights                               | How to Access                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Cloud**   | SmythOS-hosted     | Builders & teams       | Free subdomain, SSL, autoscaling         | Agent Settings → Deploy → Agent Cloud |
| **Enterprise**    | Private / On-prem  | Regulated enterprises  | Custom SLAs, private cloud, full control | Contact Sales                         |
| **Local Runtime** | Your local machine | Devs & offline testers | Lightweight, no internet needed          | Download SRL → Run locally            |

## Choosing A Deployment Mode

Choose your deployment method through the `Deploy` button in the top right corner:

## Agent Cloud (Default)

Deploy your agent to **SmythOS-hosted infrastructure**, which is ideal for most use cases if you don't want to worry about infrastructure. It is:

* Preconfigured with staging domains like `youragent.agent.pstage.smyth.ai`
* Has secure HTTPS served instantly
* Handles load without extra steps

### Why Use Agent Cloud?
- You don’t want to worry about servers, scaling, or SSL certificates.
- You want to deploy instantly to a shareable live URL.
- You want free infrastructure for testing or lightweight production use.

### Optional: Custom Domain Support

You can point your custom domain to SmythOS in three simple steps:

1. Go to [Subdomains](https://app.smythos.com/domains)
2. Click **Add Subdomain** and enter the subdomain (e.g., `test.smyth.com`)
3. You'll receive DNS instructions — create a **CNAME** record:
   - **Host**: `test.smyth.com`
   - **Target**: `b3830d6590893c02fbab61b0e08b4f8c.proxy.pstage.smyth.ai`
4. Click **Verify** after setting your DNS. It may take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate.

## Enterprise Deployments (On-Demand)

SmythOS supports highly customized deployments for organizations that need full control:

* On-premise or private VPC hosting
* Advanced network + data security
* Seamless LLM integration via custom endpoints
* Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) available

<WarningCallout title="Not Self-Service">
Enterprise deployments require setup through our team. Please [contact Sales](mailto:sales@smythos.com) to get started.
</WarningCallout>

## Local Runtime

Use [**Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)**](/docs/agent-runtime/overview) for local testing and development. It is fast, private, and offline.

<InfoCallout title="When to Use Local Runtime">
To test workflows in isolated environments or build agents for air-gapped systems and offline demos.
</InfoCallout>

### How to Deploy Locally

1. Click `Export Agent` in Builder (`Ctrl + Shift + E` or `Cmnd + Shift + E`)
2. Save the exported `agent.json`
3. Download SRL: [GitHub → Smyth Runtime Local](https://github.com/Smyth-ai/smyth-runtime-local)
4. Run your agent locally:

```bash
srl run agent.json
```

<WarningCallout title="Local Runtime Limitations"> For local model support and full API capabilities, follow progress on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/SmythOS/smyth-runtime). </WarningCallout>

## Versioning & Changelog

Every deployment is **semantic-versioned** (`Major.Minor`). See [Versioning Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/versioning) for how version numbers work and when to increment them.

- **Major** = breaking workflow changes
- **Minor** = additive or bug-fix updates

Release notes are **optional but recommended** — users see them in **Agent Settings → Deployments**.
