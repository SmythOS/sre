## Why Deploy as a Chatbot?

You’ve built the logic, workflows, and personality. Now it’s time to put your agent in front of users.

Deploying your SmythOS agent as a chatbot means:

- Embedded conversations with real-time AI logic
- No external servers, wrappers, or frameworks
- Fully brandable and secure

## Prerequisites

Before you start embedding:

- Your agent is **deployed** (any version is fine)
- You’ve enabled the **ChatBot embodiment** in **Agent Settings**
- You have access to **Vault** for API keys (optional, for auth)
- You know where the chatbot will be embedded (domain info)

## Step-by-Step: Deploy Your Chatbot

### Step 1: Configure Domain Access

1. Go to [Subdomains](https://app.smythos.com/domains)  
2. Use SmythOS default, or verify a custom one  
3. Click **Verify** to complete domain ownership check

<InfoCallout>
Test subdomains use `.stage.smyth.ai`; production uses `.pstage.smyth.ai`
</InfoCallout>

### Step 2: Enable the ChatBot Embodiment

1. Open your agent  
2. Go to **Settings → Embodiments**  
3. Toggle on **ChatBot**  
4. Fill in the optional fields:  
   - **Name** (Chatbot ID, not agent name)  
   - **Intro Message**  
   - **GPT Model**  
   - **Personality** override

### Step 3: Configure Chatbot Settings (Optional)

- **Allowed Domains** — e.g. `smythos.com, app.smythos.com`
- **Authentication** — require token or none
- **Debug Mode** — bypass auth for dev testing
- **Primary Domain** — which site to embed on

### Step 4: Customize Styles (Optional)

You can match the chatbot with your site’s look and feel:

```js
ChatBot.init({
  name: 'My Agent 101',
  introMessage: 'Happy to see you, how can I help today?',
  // humanBubbleClass: 'human-chatbox-bubble',
  // botBubbleClass: 'bot-chatbox-bubble',
});
```

```css
<style>
  .human-chatbox-bubble {
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #333;
  }
  .bot-chatbox-bubble h1 {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: #000;
  }
</style>
```

You can override layout mode, icon, theme, and more in the visual config panel.

### Step 5: Embed the Chatbot

1. Go to **Settings → Deployments → ChatBot**  
2. Click **Generate Embed Snippet**  
3. Copy and paste it at the end of your site’s `<body>` tag

Example:

```html
<script src="https://embed.smythos.com/chatbot.js"></script>
<script>
  ChatBot.init({
    agentId: "your-agent-id",
    token: "your-auth-key", // optional
    domain: "smythos.com"
  });
</script>
```
