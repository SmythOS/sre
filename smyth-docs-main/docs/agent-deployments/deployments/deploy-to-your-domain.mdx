# Deploy to Your Domain

> Give your agent a home that looks and feels like yours. Connect a custom domain or subdomain for a seamless branded experience.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Add a CNAME record with the provided target, verify your domain in SmythOS, and deploy your agent to it using Agent Cloud.

## Why Deploy Your Agent to a Custom Domain?

Deploying to your own domain allows you to:

- Deliver a branded and trusted experience for users
- Host your AI agents under URLs you control
- Build whitelabel offerings for internal teams or clients

Linking your domain puts you in control if you're launching a support assistant, embedding a chatbot, or even building a backend API.

## What You Need Before You Begin

To connect a domain, you’ll need:

- A deployed SmythOS agent (test or production)
- Access to your domain registrar or DNS management (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy)
- A subdomain (e.g., `ai.mycompany.com`) you want to use

## Step 1: Register Your Domain in SmythOS

1. Go to [Subdomains](https://app.smythos.com/domains) from the left sidebar  
2. Click **Add Subdomain**  
3. Enter your desired domain or subdomain (e.g., `ai.mycompany.com`)  
4. SmythOS will generate a unique **CNAME target** for your domain

You’ll see something like:

```text
Host: ai.mycompany.com
Target: ca0e27d8eeec9ebf4c62a76719df460a.proxy.stage.smyth.ai
```

## Step 2: Configure Your DNS with a CNAME Record

In your DNS provider (like Namecheap, Route53, or Cloudflare):

1. Create a new **CNAME** record  
2. Use your subdomain as the **Host**  
3. Paste the full target from SmythOS into the **Value**

Example:

```text
Type:   CNAME
Name:   ai
Value:  ca0e27d8eeec9ebf4c62a76719df460a.proxy.stage.smyth.ai
```

DNS propagation may take up to 24 hours depending on your provider. Wait until it's verified in SmythOS.

## Step 3: Verify the Domain in SmythOS

Once the CNAME is live:

1. Go back to **Subdomains** in SmythOS  
2. Click **Verify** next to your domain  
3. When verified, it will appear in the domain selector during agent [deployment](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)

See [Subdomains docs](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains) for troubleshooting tips and advanced routing options.

## Step 4: Deploy Your Agent to the Verified Domain

1. Go to your agent’s **Deployments → Agent Cloud** tab  
2. Select the domain from the **Subdomain** dropdown (now includes verified domains)  
3. Enter your version number and optional release notes  
4. Click **Deploy**

Your agent is now live at your own domain.

## What’s Next?

Now that your agent is running on your own domain, you can:

- Embed it as a [Chatbot](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatbot) for live user interactions
- Expose custom endpoints with [Use via API](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-api)
- Set up domain-specific analytics and [monitor usage logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs)
- Offer a branded experience to clients or internal teams
- Pair it with custom workflows, dashboards, or integrations
