# Use Your Agent via MCP Server

> **MCP makes your agent interoperable.** Integrate with tools, editors, or systems that speak the same open protocol.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Enable MCP in your agent settings, copy the development or production MCP URL, and plug it into your MCP-compatible platform.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Enable MCP Support for Your Agent?

MCP is an open standard that enables AI agents to access context, data, and tools across different systems and environments. When deployed as an MCP server:

- Your agent can be called by any MCP-enabled app
- It can maintain multi-turn context across tools
- It can execute workflows and respond using live data

This is ideal for:

- AI development teams using workbenches
- IDE or toolchain integrations
- Enterprise systems requiring protocol-based interoperability

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your agent to an MCP interface, ensure:

- Your agent is deployed (test or production)
- MCP is enabled in **Agent Settings**
- You have the correct MCP endpoint URL for your environment

<InfoCallout>
**Reminder:** Test environments use the format:  
`https://<agent-id>.agent.stage.smyth.ai`  
Production environments use:  
`https://<agent-id>.agent.psatge.smyth.ai`
</InfoCallout>

## Step-by-Step: Enable and Integrate MCP

### Step 1: Toggle MCP in Agent Settings

1. Open your agent in **Studio**  
2. Click **Settings**  
3. Find the **MCP** section  
4. Toggle MCP **on**

This will generate unique MCP URLs for test and production.

### Step 2: Copy Your MCP Endpoint URL

After enabling MCP, scroll to the **Environment** section under **Deployments** to copy your URLs.

- **Test environment:**  
  `https://<agent-id>.agent.stage.smyth.ai/mcp/sse`

- **Production environment:**  
  `https://<agent-id>.agent.psatge.smyth.ai/mcp/sse`

Choose based on your integration stage:
- Use the test URL while developing
- Switch to the production URL when ready for live deployment

## Security Considerations for MCP Endpoints

MCP currently lacks a built-in authentication standard.

<WarningCallout>
If your SmythOS agent uses [OAuth](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/authentication) or other authentication layers, it will reject unauthenticated MCP requests.
</WarningCallout>

To add auth protection, use:
- A custom proxy layer
- Third-party middleware

Always secure your production MCP endpoints appropriately.

## Common Use Cases for MCP Integration

- Connect your agent to VS Code or an AI workbench
- Integrate with internal AI dashboards or tools
- Add protocol-level context-awareness to enterprise platforms

## What’s Next?

With MCP enabled, your SmythOS agent becomes a first-class participant in any system using the Model Context Protocol. From here, you can:

- View logs and debug via **Settings → Deployments → Logs**
- [Deploy as LLM](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-llm) to expose it via `/chat/completions`
- [Deploy as ChatGPT](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatgpt) to integrate with GPT Builder

Same agent, multiple endpoints. Maximum reusability.
