# Use Agent with Postman

> Export or import your SmythOS agent endpoints with Postman to accelerate API testing, integration, and prototyping.

<InfoCallout> **TL;DR:** Export your agent's test or production endpoints as a Postman collection, or drag and drop an existing Postman collection into Builder to auto-generate agent components. </InfoCallout>

## Why Test Your Agent in Postman?

Postman is a trusted tool for testing APIs and managing request workflows. By using Postman with SmythOS, you can:

- Explore and verify agent endpoints before integrating
- Reuse collections to prototype AI workflows
- Rapidly debug, test, and update agent calls with live response previews
- Bridge external APIs with SmythOS by importing collections

This guide works best alongside [Use via API](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-api), which covers endpoint structure, authentication, and request schema.

## What You Need Before You Start

Before exporting or importing Postman collections:

- You must have at least one deployed [(See how)](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) agent in SmythOS
- Agent must have valid **test** or **production** subdomain
- To import Postman collections, ensure your requests follow JSON schema compatible with SmythOS inputs

## Export Your Agent Endpoints to Postman

Exporting a Postman collection lets you test your agent’s endpoints externally and share with other teams.

### Test Environment Collection

Use for internal or staging testing:

- Available for all agents (even before full deployment)
- Uses the **test subdomain**

Example:
```text
https://myagent.agent.stage.smyth.ai
```

### Production Environment Collection

Use once the agent is ready for production:

- Requires deployed production version
- Uses the **production subdomain**

Example:
```text
https://myagent.agent.pstage.smyth.ai
```

> Want to configure your own custom domain or learn more about subdomains? Check out [Managing Subdomains](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains).

### Steps to Download Postman Collection

1. Open your agent in **Studio**  
2. Navigate to **Deployments → Postman**  
3. Choose **Export Test** or **Export Production**  
4. Download the generated `.json` Postman collection

## Import Postman Collections into SmythOS

Already using Postman for API calls? Bring that logic directly into SmythOS.

1. Open **Builder** from the left sidebar  
2. Drag and drop your `.json` Postman collection file into the canvas  
3. SmythOS automatically converts each request into an **API Call** component

Use this if you:

- Want to reuse complex request flows
- Are migrating existing Postman logic into a SmythOS agent
- Need a no-code path from external APIs to agent workflows

## Tips for Better Postman + SmythOS Workflow

- Use Vault keys as environment variables in Postman
- Match request payloads with the schema shown in Swagger or "Try It Out"
- Use `stream: true` to test Server-Sent Event responses in your agent

## What’s Next?

Once you’ve verified your agent via Postman:

- Head to [Use via API](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-api) for more integration details
- Monitor request logs from **Deployments → Logs**
- Export updated collections whenever your agent logic changes
