# Deploy with Webhooks

> Make your agent react to the world in real time. Use SmythOS agents as event-driven webhooks to connect with external services like Discord, Google Chat, and any webhook-based platform.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Deploy your agent with a public endpoint, secure it, and connect any platform that supports outbound HTTP requests.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Connect Webhooks to Your Agent?

Webhooks let your SmythOS agent act like an event listener. When a trigger happens elsewhere... like a form being submitted, a database record changing, or a user message coming in... the source system instantly sends a payload to your agent’s webhook URL. This is ideal for:

- Real-time message posting (e.g., [Discord integration](/docs/agent-deployments/integration-components/discord-integration))
- Task automation (e.g., Google Chat or Notion updates)
- Event-based workflows with external triggers

Unlike polling, webhooks are instantaneous, efficient, and perfect for reactive agent workflows.

## Prerequisites for Webhook Deployments

Before you begin, make sure you:

- Have an existing deployed SmythOS agent. If not, [deploy your agent here](/docs/agent-deployments/overview).
- Understand the webhook format of your target platform (e.g., Discord, Google Chat).
- Have appropriate authentication set up via [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

## Step 1: Create a Webhook-Ready Endpoint

1. In your SmythOS Agent:  
   - Add an **Agent Skill** component and name it something like `WebhookReceiver`.  
   - Define the inputs your target service will send (e.g., `event`, `message`, `timestamp`).

2. Follow it with a **Code Component** or **LLM Component** to process the input.

3. End the workflow with an **API Output** component to format and return a valid HTTP response to the caller.

You can also [Deploy via MCP Server](//docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server) if you need additional authentication, throttling, or multi-agent routing.

## Step 2: Secure the Webhook Endpoint

> Open webhooks are risky. Always protect your endpoints.

Use one of the following authentication options:

### Bearer Token Authentication

- Generate your token in agent settings and store it in Vault.  
- Enable Bearer Token Auth in agent settings and provide your token.  
- All incoming requests must include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer your-token
```

### OAuth OIDC Authentication

- For SSO or email-domain restricted flows.  
- Set up via your SmythOS organization settings.

See [Authentication Setup](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/authentication) for full details.

## Step 3: Connect Your Platform to the Webhook

Once your agent has a public, secure endpoint:

- Go to your selected third-party service  
- Navigate to their webhook configuration area (e.g., Discord Server Settings, Google Chat Space Settings)  
- Paste your agent’s endpoint URL  
- Map outgoing fields from the service to your agent’s expected inputs

> Always consult the official platform docs to match formatting expectations.

### Payload Format Examples

**Google Chat:**
```json
{
  "text": "Hello from SmythOS!"
}
```

**Discord:**
```json
{
  "content": "Alert: New event triggered by your agent!"
}
```

## Step 4: Process the Webhook Data in SmythOS

Configure these components to handle incoming webhook data:

- **Webhook Handler (Agent Skill)** – Receives the POST request  
- **Code Component** – Parses and validates the payload  
- **LLM Prompt (Optional)** – Adds AI logic or dynamic reasoning  
- **API Output** – Formats the final response for the external platform

> Use defensive logic in the Code Component to handle missing or malformed inputs.

## Step 5: Format and Return a Response

Return a payload structured for the target platform:

**Discord:**
```json
{
  "content": "Here’s your update!",
  "embeds": [{
    "title": "SmythOS Webhook Triggered",
    "description": "Workflow completed with output: ${data.output}"
  }]
}
```

**Google Chat:**
```json
{
  "text": "Your request was processed successfully."
}
```

> Always test using Postman, curl, or the platform’s native test tools.

## Step 6: Register and Activate the Webhook

Finally, register the webhook URL in your platform:

- **Discord:** Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → Create  
- **Google Chat:** Space Settings → Add Incoming Webhook  
- **Notion:** Use Zapier or Make to trigger workflows  
- **Zapier:** Choose "Webhook" as the trigger/action and enter your agent’s URL

> Once registered, your agent will begin receiving POST data from the platform in real time.

## Example Integration: Zapier + SmythOS

Use [Zapier](https://zapier.com) to trigger your agent from thousands of apps:

1. Set a Zapier trigger (e.g., "New row in Google Sheet")  
2. Add a **Webhook Action** to POST data to your agent  
3. Your SmythOS agent processes and responds to the payload

## What’s Next?

- Explore [Slack, WhatsApp, or Telegram](/docs/agent-deployments/integration-components/whatsapp-integration) webhook flows
- Build advanced workflows triggered by multiple external sources
- Add [logging](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) to monitor and debug webhook activity
- Consider [MCP deployment](//docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server) for higher control and flexibility
