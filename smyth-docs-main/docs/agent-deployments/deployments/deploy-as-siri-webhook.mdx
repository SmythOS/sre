# Use Siri with SmythOS (Webhook Integration)

> Trigger agents with your voice. Connect Apple’s Siri Shortcuts to SmythOS using secure webhook URLs and unlock hands-free workflows on iOS.

<InfoCallout> **TL;DR:** Set up a Siri Shortcut that sends an HTTP request to your SmythOS agent's webhook endpoint, and your voice becomes your interface. </InfoCallout>

## Why Use Siri to Activate Your SmythOS Agent?

Siri is already built into your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch... so why not turn it into a control center for your AI agent?

With this integration, you can:

- Trigger workflows by voice ("Hey Siri, summarise my inbox")
- Launch tasks without touching a screen
- Build accessibility-friendly AI assistants
- Combine native iOS automations with your SmythOS agents

<Divider />

## What You Need to Get Started

- A deployed SmythOS agent with webhook support
- Your agent must be publicly accessible (e.g., [Deploy via Webhook](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-webhook))
- iPhone or iPad with iOS 14+
- The **Shortcuts** app installed (usually default on iOS)

## Step 1: Get Your SmythOS Webhook URL

1. Go to your deployed agent in SmythOS  
2. Click **Deploy** and select **Webhook**  
3. Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-agent.smythos.com/api/v1/chat`)  
4. If needed, configure authentication using a **Bearer Token** or set up [Vault access](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)

<InfoCallout> You can test this webhook first using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - [we also have a guide on how](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/use-postman) - or `curl` to ensure it responds correctly before adding it to Siri. </InfoCallout>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Siri Shortcut

1. Open the **Shortcuts** app on your iOS device  
2. Tap **+** to create a new Shortcut  
3. Tap **Add Action** and search for `Get Contents of URL`  
4. Select it and configure:
   - **Method**: POST  
   - **URL**: Paste your webhook URL from SmythOS  
   - **Request Body**: Select `JSON` and add key-value pairs based on your agent inputs

```json
{
  "prompt": "Summarize the latest updates",
  "user": "siri-user"
}
```

5. (Optional) Add a **Text** action or `Show Result` to display the response  
6. Name your Shortcut (e.g., "Run SmythOS Agent") and enable Siri by tapping **Add to Siri**

## Step 3: Trigger the Agent with Your Voice

Once added, just say:

> "Hey Siri, Run SmythOS Agent"

…and the webhook will be triggered, sending data to your agent and receiving the response in your shortcut flow.

<Divider />

## Handle and Display the Agent Response

You can enhance the Shortcut by:

- Showing the response using **Show Result**  
- Logging it in **Notes** or **Reminders**  
- Sending it via iMessage or Email

<InfoCallout> Pro tip: Use the response JSON fields to power conditional logic or route data to other iOS apps. </InfoCallout>

## What’s Next?

- [Deploy more endpoints](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) to link multiple voice commands  
- [Log all invocations](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) in SmythOS to track Siri activity  
- Use **Scheduled Tasks** to mix hands-free and timed automations
