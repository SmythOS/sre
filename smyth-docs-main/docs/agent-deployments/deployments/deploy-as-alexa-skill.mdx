# Deploy as Alexa Skill

> **Your agent, now voice-enabled.** Connect it to Alexa and let users talk to it like a human.

<InfoCallout> **TL;DR:** Copy your SmythOS Alexa endpoint → set up a Custom Alexa Skill → wire the endpoint as your handler. Alexa now speaks for your agent. </InfoCallout>

## Why Deploy Your Agent to Alexa?

Voice extends your agent’s reach. Alexa integration lets users interact naturally with no screens or keyboards required. It’s ideal for:

- Personal assistants
- FAQ bots
- Home automation agents
- Productivity helpers

All it takes is one endpoint and a little setup.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following ready:

- A deployed SmythOS agent (must be public; no authentication)
- An Amazon Developer account ([sign up here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa))
- Basic agent behavior already configured

## Step 1: Get Your SmythOS Alexa Endpoint URL

1. Go to your **SmythOS Dashboard**
2. Select your deployed agent
3. Open the **Test** sidebar and click the **Alexa** tab
4. Copy the provided endpoint... it looks like this:

```text
https://<your-agent>.agent.stage.smyth.ai/alexa
```

<InfoCallout> For production, swap `stage` with `pstage`. </InfoCallout>

## Step 2: Create a New Alexa Skill in the Developer Console

1. Visit the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask)
2. Click **Create Skill**
3. Enter a name (e.g. "My SmythOS Agent")
4. Choose **Custom** for the model
5. Select **Start from scratch**
6. Click **Create Skill**

<Divider />

## Step 3: Add Your SmythOS Endpoint as the Skill Handler

1. In the left sidebar, go to **Endpoint**
2. Set **Service Endpoint Type** to `HTTPS`
3. Paste your SmythOS Alexa URL in **Default Region**
4. Under Certificate Type, select:
   - `My development endpoint is a sub-domain...`
5. Save changes

## Step 4: Choose an Invocation Name for Your Skill

1. In the sidebar, go to **Invocation**
2. Enter how users will launch your agent (e.g., "my agent")
3. Save the model

<Divider />

## Step 5: Add a Custom Intent for User Queries

1. Navigate to **Intents** → click **Add Intent**
2. Name it `SmythOSAgentIntent`
3. Create a custom intent
4. Add the following sample utterances:

```text
{searchQuery}
ask {searchQuery}
tell me {searchQuery}
find {searchQuery}
search for {searchQuery}
```

5. When prompted, create the `searchQuery` slot
6. Set its type to `AMAZON.SearchQuery`

<Divider />

## Step 6: Build and Test Your Alexa Skill

1. Click **Build Model** (wait for it to finish)
2. Open the **Test** tab
3. Enable testing in `Development` mode
4. Try your invocation:

```text
Alexa, open my agent
Alexa, ask what’s the weather in New York
```

<Divider />

## How Your Alexa-Connected Agent Works Behind the Scenes

- The invocation triggers your agent via the Alexa endpoint
- Alexa sends the query using the `searchQuery` slot
- SmythOS handles it and returns a response
- Alexa reads the agent’s reply aloud

<Divider />

## Known Limitations and Constraints

- Only public agents without authentication are supported
- Alexa limits the character count in responses
- Visuals and complex UI are not supported
- Users must re-invoke your skill after each interaction

<Divider />

## Optional: Publish Your Alexa Skill to the Public

Want to go public?

1. Open the **[Distribution](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/devconsole/about-the-developer-console.html)** tab in the Alexa console, part of the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) developer console
2. Fill in:
   - Skill description
   - Sample phrases
   - Icons (108x108 and 512x512)
   - Privacy and terms URLs
3. Submit for certification

## What’s Next?

Now that your voice interface is live:

- Track usage inside SmythOS Agent Settings → **[Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs)**
- Iterate on your agent logic, then rebuild the Alexa model
- Explore alternate voice use cases with [MCP](//docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server) or [ChatBot](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatbot) deployments

Your agent just got its voice. What you do with it is up to you.
