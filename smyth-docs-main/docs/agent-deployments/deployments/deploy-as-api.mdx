# Use Agent via API

> **Direct. Documented. Developer-friendly.** Access your agent's endpoints with Swagger UI and OpenAPI.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Open your agent’s API embodiment, grab the OpenAPI URL, and use the Swagger interface to test, verify, and integrate.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Access Your Agent via API?

This method is ideal if you want to:

- Send HTTP requests directly to your agent
- Test behavior and payloads in Swagger before deploying to production
- Integrate with other tools, backends, or systems without using UI elements
- Reuse agent logic across internal apps, CRMs, dashboards, or mobile apps

## What You Need Before You Start

Before interacting with the API embodiment, make sure:

- Your agent is deployed (test, production, or versioned)
- You have a Vault API key with the correct scopes
- You know your environment’s [subdomain](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains) URL (`stage` or `pstage`)

## Step-by-Step: Use the SmythOS Agent API

### Step 1: Open the API Embodiment in Your Dashboard

1. Navigate to your agent’s **Deployments** tab  
2. Find and click on the **API** embodiment in the Environment section  
3. A Swagger UI will load with all available endpoints

<InfoCallout>
Each endpoint maps to a callable block or function in your agent logic.
</InfoCallout>

### Step 2: Get the OpenAPI URL for Your Agent

The OpenAPI schema is located at:

```text
https://<your-agent-subdomain>/api-docs/openapi.json
```

Examples:

```text
Test: https://salesbot.agent.stage.smyth.ai/api-docs/openapi.json  
Prod: https://salesbot.agent.pstage.smyth.ai/api-docs/openapi.json
```

You can import this URL into third-party tools like Postman or [GPT Builder](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatgpt).

### Step 3: Test and Explore Endpoints with Swagger

1. Select your **Server** from the dropdown (e.g., test or production)  
2. Click on any endpoint to expand it  
3. Click **Try it out** to activate edit mode  
4. Modify the payload as needed  
5. Click **Execute** to send the request and view the response

<WarningCallout>
Swagger does not support multi-line JSON by default. Keep payloads single-line or escape newline characters.
</WarningCallout>

## What Comes After API Integration?

Now that your API is live:

- Monitor usage from **Deployments → Logs**
- Use the same OpenAPI URL in SDKs or GPT Builder
- Combine this embodiment with LLM or ChatBot deployment to serve multiple access channels
