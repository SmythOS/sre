# SmythOS SDK

The SDK is a lightweight wrapper around the Smyth Runtime Environment. It lets you create and run agents with minimal setup while still allowing advanced customisation when needed.

Read the full tutorial in [docs/sdk/getting-started.md](../docs/sdk/getting-started.md) and explore the other guides in [docs/sdk](../docs/sdk/README.md).

The `examples/` folder contains runnable projects demonstrating the features in action.
